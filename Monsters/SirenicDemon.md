# Sirenic Demon, the Malevolent Infestation

A submissive servant of Talona, mistress of poison, has become a disease itself. By sacrificing life via toxic herbal concoctions, the Sirenic Demon gained favor with Talona and parasitically melded minds with mycelium network of the sirenic mushroom. It continously connects his mouth to the center of the mycelium network and drains it of all nutrients. The Demon uses It's telepathic link to the fungal neural network to siphon nutrients from other nodes of the network to feed it. 

In appearance The demon is a Deep purple and grey slug-like being with many mouths with long jagged teeth that are in rows like that of a shark. In a patternless fashion, long slender limbs protrude from the slugs body with tiny hands with giant barblike hooks at the end. It is covered in open black sores that occasionally emit a foul, noxious gas and leaks a putrid poison. 

The Malevolent Infestation sinks the end of it's blobular slug-like body where the most prominent mouth is into a large mass of sirenic fungus and takes control of the mind of the network. It's primal desire is to feed off the fungal nutrients, but rather than maintaining a healthy nutrient balance like an unpossessed sirenic network would, it's gluttonous nature fervently thirst upon all living things in the ground and near the fungal patches. While the Malevolent Infestation is connected to the Network, it can remotely cast verbal and somatic spells at a limited range.

## Actions

**Legendary Resistance (3):**  
If the Demon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Bite**
A mouth with an uncountable amount of teeth opens to an unnaturally large gape and comes down and closes on its victim. 5 foot range.
+8 to hit, 1d12 + 6 for damage.

**Barb (Bonus Action)**
Can use its long, unnatural barbed limbs to reach in a 10 foot range and hook a target. The target must Make a strength saving throw of 15 or be pulled into the demon.
+8 to hit, 1d8 + 4 damage.
If a target is pulled into its pustulating body, it must succeed on a constitution saving throw of 15. On a failed save the target takes 2d10 poison damage or take half as much on a failed save

**Blight (4th level spell)**
Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies

**Cloudkill (5th level spell, Concentration)**
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

**Ray of Sickness**
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.


**Dominate Person (5th level spell, Concentration)**
You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

**Dominate Beast (4th level spell, concentration)**
You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.
