> I'm Dming a dnd game and I'm going to rely on you to help me improvise. I'll give a short phrase like, "fancy inn" or "low level creature" and I need you to give me a short description of the place/characters and provide a name and any stats that may be required. I may provide a supplemental description that I already have that I would like you to regard in your response. Also if you could make it easy to skim, even better.
