# Merry Christmas

> Ahh, Christmas. The most wonderful time of the year. Every body is just full of energy and has an extra pep in their step. That could be that the deadlines are shorter, the quotas are larger, and the peppermint milkshakes they serve at lunch give you the runs, but I don't think so. I think it's because there's Christmas magic in the air. 

> You guys are filling in for some older elves that picked this week to take a vacation. Bastards. Why is it that you have to work a new job the week of Christmas? You've never even BEEN in sector W of the workshop before this week. The W of course stands for wood. It's the woodshop. There's so much dust your boogers are black. You think to yourselves, why couldn't it have been batteries or even doll-baby barbershop? Ohwell.

> You guys clean up your stations, unknowingly putting your things in all the wrong spots and make your way to the time punch to clock out. You see (insert number of players here) other elves you that look just as out of place as you.

Have the players describe their characters and introduce themselves. 


### Quick Layout Notes
- Santa's Lair is in the shape of a candy cane.
- The workshop is at the tail end of the cane. opens up into a hallway that opens up into several other workshops, a dining hall, a sled hangar, utility closets, and at the curve is the elf bunks. Santa's house in a spire at the end that is adorned to look like a giant coniferous tree.
- There is a reindeer barn outside at the bottom of the cane.

After a while have them notice a frantic elf nearby

## Rhubarb Moontree

Rhubarb is an elf who is looking backing and forth like he is looking for something but you see that he is visibly shaking.
