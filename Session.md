# Merry Christmas

> Ahh, Christmas. The most wonderful time of the year. It's Christmas Eve at that. Every body is just full of energy and has an extra pep in their step. That could be that the deadlines are shorter, the quotas are larger, and the peppermint milkshakes they serve at lunch give you the runs, but I don't think so. I think it's because there's Christmas magic in the air. 

> You guys are filling in for some older elves that picked this week to take a vacation. Bastards. Why is it that you have to work a new job the week of Christmas? You've never even BEEN in sector W of the workshop before this week. The W of course stands for wood. It's the woodshop. There's so much dust your boogers are black. You think to yourselves, why couldn't it have been batteries or even doll-baby barbershop? Ohwell.

> You guys clean up your stations, unknowingly putting your things in all the wrong spots and make your way to the time punch to clock out. You see (insert number of players here) other elves you that look just as out of place as you.

Have the players describe their characters and introduce themselves. 


### Quick Layout Notes
- Santa's Lair is in the shape of a candy cane.
- The workshop is at the tail end of the cane. opens up into a hallway that opens up into several other workshops, a dining hall, a sled hangar, utility closets, and at the curve is the elf bunks. Santa's house in a spire at the end that is adorned to look like a giant coniferous tree.
- There is a reindeer barn outside at the bottom of the cane.
- The hangar is at the end of the cane.

After a while have them notice a frantic elf nearby enter from the hangar.

## Rhubarb Moontree

Rhubarb is an elf who is looking backing and forth like he is looking for something but you see that he is visibly shaking and looking frantically. Asking several other people to help.

### Description of Rhubarb
- An elf with dark brown hair going in every direction with bits of hay stuck in it.
- a set of snow goggles that are strung around his neck.
- tunic is worn and dirty but have warmer, fur lined insides.
- An obvious blowout of a hole where is right pocked should be in his jacket.
- Perception of 10 reveals that he has a can of reindeer treats on his side in a holster.

### Rhubarb's plea for help
In a shouting whisper
> You, please! I may have made the biggest mistake of my life and I need your help. I've lost Rude Dolf's orb of direction and I could use a couple extra set of eyes to look for it, I don't see very well in the dark. I was just transporting it and it fell out of a whole in my jacket! If I don't get this fastened to Rude Dolf's face before midnight Mr. Clause won't be able to navigate his sleigh. We can't have another incident like 1732. Not to mention what will happen to ME if I fail us. I know I had it on my way to the barn and retraced my steps here and I just didn't see it!

- A `History Check` of DC 10 reveals that the incident of 1732 was where Santa got lost in Asia and couldn't get back. A special ops team had to be sent to track him down and located him piss drunk in the streets of Thialand weeks later. 
- If a player rolls less than 5 that player thinks he's talking about 9/11.

### Note
Rudolf's name is actually Rude Dolf as he is kind of a butt. There isn't anything special about him but Santa uses him to fix his orb of direction to him. Santa just thinks it gives the reindeer crew a little funcshway (sp) and is more inspiring to children than a boring old, magical item. Rude Dolf let the fame go to his head and has become a little bit of a Diva.

- Rhubarb is the reindeer keeper and had them out for their afternoon graze and realized Rude Dolf's Orb of Direction has fallen off his face

## Useful Items
- Sleds from the sled hangar. The sleds have chambers on the back to put bags of ultimate propulsion on and trickers on the front handle bars for moving up steep hills. There are one man and two man sleds. A sled can hold 2 bags of propulsion.
    - And bags of ultimate propulsion ( liquid nitrogen rockets )
- Flare guns (if used as a projectile can fire 120 feet and does a d8 of damage)
- Snow gear (snow shoes, ice picks, rock climbing gear)

# Path to the Barn

- The orb was dropped on the way from the sled hangar to the Reindeer barn.
- A set of tracks is found in the snow from Rhubarb's tracks that go out into the woods. A `Survival Check` of DC 10 reveals this is obviously a Yeti that wondered up here and may have taken in back.

## Rhubarb's Knowledge
- Yeti's are often nomadic creatures that like to stick to themselves
- Don't leave their den's for much other than food
- Don't like to be disturbed for any reason
- Had a yeti break into the barn overnight once and all they took was a stack of books.
- Thinks a few might live in an icy canyon a ways off and they should prepare for a treacherous journey
- is willing to offer his next year's salary if they won't go or else it will be his head.

Rhubarb needs to stay behind to prepare the reindeer for their flight, as Santa will probably want to take off regardless of whether he has the orb of direction or not.

# Tracking the Yeti
- If at any point they are walking too much, remind the players that time is of the essence.

The tracks lead to a long downhill slope.

## Sledding Events

- 4 rounds of a sledding events to reach the bottom.
- Have the player roll a d8 or d12 or however many events we have to determine what happens.
- If a player falls off their sled, a bag of ultimate propulsion must be used to rescue them (or some other means) as walking down the slope will take too long. When a bag is used, a DC 5 strength check must be made unless they are strapped to the sled, otherwise the sled will launch without them and take a d4 damage from the rocket burn.

1. Nothing interesting happens
1. Nothing interesting happns
1. You run over a smooth stone that launches you in the air like a downhill skiier. a `DC 10 acrobatics` check needs to be made to land smoothly. On a failed save of 5 or below you follow off. on a 6-9, take d4 of damage for the rough landing.
1. A tree blocks your path and has you steer violently to avoid the tree you fly through a thicket of thorns and branches slashing and thrashing your face and body and you take a d4 of damage.
1. A family of rabbits is crossing your path right in front of you. Avoiding requires a `Dexterity Check` of 10 to avoid splattering them. 
1. You find yourself on an icy river that converges into an icy tunnel. (If somebody is already in the tunnel from a previous turn they fly in through the top via a crevice and take 1d6 falling damage on a failed DC 10 dex save)As you fly through the tunnel it opens up into a large underground cave and the sunlight shining through you can make out that you are flying through an abandoned mine, presumably for coal used for bad childrens gifts.
1. You blast through an animated snowman and your head gets stuck in the snowman's head in cartoonish like fashion and his face is frozen in shock and dismay. You are currently blinded and cannot see, the snow falls off at the end of their next turn.
1. You are quickly coming up on a wall of densely packed trees. You think there is a small chance you can swerve to avoid the trees or there is small hump of snow you think you might be able to use as a ramp
    - a ramp is a `DC 10 acrobatics` or take a d4 of damage from landing. Failig with a 5 or less means missing the ramp and taking a d8 tree stump to the chest and you fall off your sled which keeps moving without you
    - steering around the trees is a `DC 15 Dexterity check` or take a d4 of damage as a tree branch slaps you in the face as you move by. Failing with a 9 or less means you're taking a d8 tree stump to the chest and you fall off your sled which keeps moving without you

# Base of the Canyon

At the base of the canyon the player with the highest `Passive Perception` or any ranger picks up on the set of yeti tracks that lead into a hallway of ice. After following the tracks for a little bit you come upon the following.

> A set of stairs carved into the ice wall appears and you can see that they ascend to a front door made from felled pine trees half-hazardly put together. Out of two windows emminate a flickering, sterile light, and you can faintly hear canned laughter and silly sounding music. The tracks you were following lead to the front door. An stone ornament rests at the bottom of the stairs. It's the shape of a human holding a sign that says, 'Welcome to the Abonimable's Home'

## The Yeti family
Consisting of the mother, Anita Abominable, and three children, Bobby, Tommy, and Chucky Abominable.

The boyfriend is Heath Snowfoot who is out being a degenerate.
