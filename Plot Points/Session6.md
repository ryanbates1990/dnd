# Treehouse

## Will of the Feywild
- Cursed by one of the other sisters (Bavlorna or Endelyn) to take human form without Skabatha's knowledge.
- actually an Oni (a large, magical giant thing) named Mugan.
- Formerly employed by Skabatha to Kidnap children.
- If Will is affected by a spell that ends a curse, it regains its evil alignment and attacks whoever is responsible for lifting the curse, shouting, "How could you?" as it fights to the death.
- Will is aware of his true form but cannot use them unless he is about to die in fear of scaring off the other children and the party.

## Skabatha
- Believes children are better off with her.
- Unaware that Will is Mugan, and thinks Mugan simply left her employment
- She offers her assistance to those who are haunted by regret. Her deals often result in cruel twists; for example, a petitioner who asks to be reunited with a lost love might be transformed into one of their loved one's cherished items, such as a favorite bonnet.
- If her key stops turning, she immediately turns violent

### Skabatha's Appearance
Skabatha appears as a short, thin, gnarled woman swathed in a tattered dress with petticoats. Cracked white face paint plasters her features, with crimson splotches on her cheeks and thick mascara coating her sparse eyelashes. Underneath her makeup, her flesh is textured like rotten bark and infested with wood lice and fungus. The windup key sticking out of her back is a part of her body and no easier to remove than one of her limbs. Skabatha roams Thither on her flying rocking horse (see chapter 3 for its stat block), which creaks horribly as it moves.

## Little Oak
- Treant 
- Has a treehouse and swings and ropes dangling from him

## The Gang (all children)

| Name      | Sex | Race | Personality | Appearance |
| --------- | ---- |----------- | ------ | -----| 
| Will      | Male | Human (Oni)   | gangster, mischevious, brave, impulsive | brown skin, fro, greens and blues |
| Bobi   | Male | Dwarf        | boisterous, bold | short, chubby, light stubble on face, red flannel shirt |
| Sloane | Female | Wood Elf| sarcastic, bratty, snobby | Tan, long gray hair, green eyes, silvers and blues |
| Zennor | Female | Orc| tenacious, fierce, brave | Slender frame, short tusks, wearing blacks and a cobalt blue vest |

- all the children (besides Will) were previously enslaved by Skabatha 

## The Plan
**The Approach.** Bobi, Sloane, Zennor, and Star will creep through the woods to the west of the tree and hide just out of sight of the screaming scarecrows (area L5). Meanwhile, Will will sneak around to the entrance to the kitchen (area L13) on the east side of the tree.

**The Distraction.** The characters will enter the goblin market (area L2) posing as travelers, purchase some sweets, and arrange for a meeting with the hag. During the meeting, the children will alert the screaming scarecrows and thereby lure the tin soldiers into the garden.

**The Escape.** While everyone is distracted, the characters will free the captives from the workshop (area L4) while Will climbs into the textile mill (area L12) to free the captives there. Once the children are set free, everyone will run back to Little Oak.


# Session Plan

# 1 . Little Oak comes across the Wayward Pool
> You guys are sitting in the small cabin in build on Little Oak who is walking liesurely through the wood. The thick wood typically keeps the forest pretty dim, but the cabin suddenly gets noticeably brighter. You look out the window and see a clearing in the trees. In that clearing you see a small lake reflecting the familiar twilight hues of the feywild sky with a thin layer of mist slightly obscuring the otherwise transluscent surface of the water.

- Will says, "Ah, looks like we've come across the wayword pool once again." Will suggests trying to find lamorna stating, "We've actually made it to the pool which is quite the feat but we've never found Lamorna. She might know something we don't. You guys should check it out."

- As people pile out of Little Oak, have everyone make DC 10 Dexterity Checks. Any character that fails slips off the roap latter and falls 10 feet and takes 1 d6 damage.
- Tell Sam what he sees and have the other players describe their character's appearance to him.

# 2. The Wayward Pool

### Notes
- can only be reached if one is disguising one's self as a unicorn
- All nonmagical flames in the region are extinguished. (A fire that's ignited in the bowl of coals on the lake's central island is an exception to this rule.)
- Beasts and Fey have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in the region.
- Any creature that bathes in the lake for at least 1 minute can choose to end 1 level of exhaustion affecting it or one curse affecting it. Alternatively, the creature can end its attunement to one cursed magic item.

Description
- There is a small islet in the middle of the lake (250 feet of fresh, still water).
- The lake is 30 feet deep. Islet is 30 feet wide and 40 feet long

- The islet contains a craggy hill that shoots up to 30 feet above the lakes surface. It is adorned with evergreens.
- Atop the islet is an iron bowl filled with coals. If a creature lights a fire in the coals, Lamorna appears on teh lakeshore a minute later, otherwise stays hidden.

If Lamorna Appears:
> The lakeshore mists part to reveal a white horse with a single gleaming horn on her brow. She stands perfectly still, silently observing you.

- Lamorna flees at the sign of aggression.
- She speaks telepathically once players are within 60 feet.
- Lamorna is curious as to why players are here in thither.

### What does Lamorna know?
- Zybilna used to rule over all of Prismeer but was usurped by her sisters.. the hags
- Zybilna was vainglorious and deceitful at times, but her magic kept Prismeer safe and isolated.
- The hags captured Lamorna's mate, Elidon, stole his horn, and used the magic to imprison Zybilna in her stronghold, The Palace of Heart's Desire.
- Lamorna thinks Elidon's Horn could in fact free Zybilna but she is not sure. She believes the unicorn is in the Hag's Prison.. If he was dead, Lamorna believes that she would have sensed it.

### What does Lamorna know about the Palace of Heart's Desire?

- When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, no one could enter her palace without an invitation. It's unlikely that the Hourglass Coven is capable of enforcing similar restrictions on the palace.
- A library on the second floor of the palace contains Zybilna's most treasured tomes.
- A dragon-like creature called a jabberwock lives in Zybilna's palace and frequently prowls the forest. The jabberwock tries to reach Wayward Pool but is always turned away by the lake's protective magic. Lamorna emphasizes that the characters would be wise to avoid the jabberwock, for once it sets its fiery eyes on prey, it rarely gives up the hunt.

# 3. Zarak Attacks!

- As the character's wind down their conversation with Lamorna read:
> A cloaked figure springs from the forest and, with blades flashing, attacks the unicorn. Under the assassin's cowl, you see a wide, toothy smile.
- roll for initiative
- Standing about 4 feet tall, is a small, impish looking full blooded orc.
- Characters with passive perception of 17 or higher are not surprised
- On Lamorna's first turn she teleports away.

Zarak is surprised and says, ""I didn't know unicorns could do that,"" and he does not antaganoize the characters. If the characters attack him he tries to stand down and make peace. 
- Zarak says he will give up the hunt for Lamorna for cash.
- Characters can tell him about Nib and Zarak will take all his cursed gold if taken there.
- Zarak will not surrender weapons or freedom.
- If he feels he will lose, drinks his potion of invisibility, and retreats

if Charmed or some other sort of magic Zarak knows:

- Most of the creatures in Zybilna's palace, including Zybilna, are frozen in time. The hags of the Hourglass Coven used an artifact called Iggwilv's Cauldron to accomplish this effect. Zarak doesn't know exactly how the cauldron or its magic works.
- The self-proclaimed leader of the League of Malevolence is a human sorcerer named Kelek. He wants to take custody of a magic staff belonging to his hated rival, the wizard Ringlerun, who is among those frozen in Zybilna's palace. Apparently, a unicorn's horn is needed to free Ringlerun from temporal stasis, which would then enable Kelek to seize Ringlerun's staff.
- Zargash, a human priest of Orcus, is another member of the League of Malevolence. Although he hopes to challenge Kelek's leadership one day, Zargash won't do anything about it as long as Kelek is protected by Warduke, a mercenary who has a flame tongue longsword.
- A fifth member of the League of Malevolence, a human warlock named Skylla, gets her magic from an archfey named Baba Yaga. Skylla knows more about Iggwilv's Cauldron and the hags of the Hourglass Coven than anyone else (as far as Zarak knows). But she has gone missing, and none of the other members of the league know where to find her.


# 4. Going Back to Little Oak and Will
- Will is outside dangling from Little Oak's branches
> Little Oak looks like he was leasurely milling about in a small clearing. As you appraoch,  Will jumps out the window grabbing a rope and gracefully slides down to the ground. 

> "We've been talkin. We just want to make sure we're clear on the plan. You guys don't seem like you're from around here so let me give you the lay of the land. If we're gonna trust you guys we need to know you guys can keep your end of the deal. Say, who's this? (Points at Sam's Character)"  

Will wants to go over the plan one more time

> "We've adjusted the plan just a smidge. I'll show you." and he grabs a stick and begins drawing in the dirt.

- Draw a rough sketch of Loomlurch and go through the plan one more time.
- They can arrange a meeting by speaking to Chucklehead the goblin boss (L2) or Pincushion, the living doll in L9. Any meeting is in the parlou is in L3.

- Little Oak doesn't get too far to LoomLurch and pauses and says everyone needs to walk from here. 
- Will will go with the players since they're going more or less in the same direction.
- The other Children break off to the west.


# 5. Approaching Loomlurch

> The forest is becoming increasingly dense, and dark. The trees are becoming unfathomably large, some look to be maybe 60 feet in diameter and you're unable to see the tops. The forest is dark but you can see dim light flickering up ahead like fireflies.

- Passive Perception of 15 or higher can hear heavy, snotlike breathing in the nearby wood. Perception check of 20 can see a pair of small red caps hiding behind trees just ahead

- 2 Redcaps attack the party, each snickering and growling and cackling

- It is at this point that Juan is overcome with a feeling that his lost thing is near. You think back to the vision of the fog, you smiling once again. For a fleeting moment, you feel whole again.

> As you approach you come across a creek, about 12 feed wide, flowing gently near perpindicular to a collossal fallen oak. Crossing the creek are a pair of small bridges carved from the roots of the tree's remains. From the tree' s remains you can see firelight spilling out from carved out windows shedding light on a small market set up out front with stalls. Noise sounds like a generally merry crowd. Out of the fallen tree you see giant, living trees growing from the remains of the tree, giving the appearance like large towers.. You can see 3 of them, each about 100 feet apart.

## Crossing the Root Bridges
- One leads to L3 (Parlour), the other leads to L2, the Goblin Market
> As you approach a gnarled bridge fromed by tangled tree roots spanning a rocky, mostly dried up riverbed, Make a stealth check.
- DC 12, on failure, the Bridges make an abnormally loud creak, and you notice a couple heads turn in the market towards you. Their stares linger for just a moment and resume what they were doing.


## LoomLurch (general)
- The workshop is operated by kidnapped children who are allowed a small measure of freedom to carry out their labors, under the watchful eyes of the hag's minions (red capps and tin men soldiers)

**Ceilings.** Unless otherwise noted, ceilings throughout Loomlurch are 8 feet high.

**Doors.** Loomlurch's doors are made of sturdy wood with iron handles and fittings. All doors are unlocked unless the text says otherwise. As an action, a character using thieves' tools can make a successful DC 14 Dexterity check to pick the lock on a locked door, or a character can try to force a door open, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

**Floors, Walls, and Stairs**. Floors, walls, and staircases are hewn out of the wood of the giant tree.

**Windows.** Loomlurch's windows are openable but are latched shut from the inside.

# Skabatha's Routine

- After waking from a long rest, she putters about in her garden (area L5) for 1d3 hours.
- Most of her day is spent in the kitchen (area L13), with occasional visits to the study (area L14).
- Before going to bed, the hag spends 1 hour conducting an inspection of the sewing room (area L9), the textile mill (area L12), and the workshop (area L4). 
- After the inspection, Granny Nightshade moves to her bedroom (area L16), miniaturizes herself, and takes a long rest inside the dollhouse there.

# Encounter with Skabatha
- She presents herself as a kind old grandma unless angered
- She says she earned those lost things fair and square. She claims undisputable ownership.
- She is willing to negotiate with the characters who want to procure them or potentially something else.
- She will only give up 1 item per task, no group prize for an errand
- She offers no help with the task.

## Tasks
1. Capture Will of the Feywild
1. Find the Lost Unicorn Horn that Bavlorna recently lost
1. Spoil a Play performed in Motherhorn, Endelyn Moongrave's castle in Yon

If Skabatha is slain, a beetle emerges from her rotten flesh and whispers Endelyn Moongrave's weakness to Skabatha's killer: "Endelyn fears eclipses, not just real ones but symbolic ones as well. If you want to kill her, best do it during an eclipse, or her body will re-form."

## Skabatha's Ring of Keys that can be Stolen

1. The first key locks and unlocks the doors leading from the garden (area L5) to the workshop (area L4) and the sewing room (area L9), and the door between areas L6 and L11.
1. The second key locks and unlocks the doors to the kitchen (area L13) and Mishka's chains there.
1. The third key locks and unlocks the door to the cell in the kitchen (area L13).

# Children of LoomLurch
-  lured children from the Witchlight Carnival
- trapped in the workshop
- they are kept safe and healthy
- harming them causes them to vanish
- Children free of Granny Nightshade's tyranny have no easy way to return home, but they can take refuge at Little Oak's treehouse or be left in the care of the unicorn Lamorna at Wayward Pool. The dwarf Elkhorn (see area L13) insists on remaining in Thither to care for the children if no one else will. If Zybilna is freed from her stasis, she returns the children to their proper homes.
