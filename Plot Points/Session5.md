# Session Start

## Session Recap
- Traveled through the jungle and made decent progress
- Came across a compost wasteland, where you met a necrotic reptile and poisonous worms. 
- Malthos attempted to speak to the mushrooms where he was taken possession of and turned on Yuri. 
- He was quickly subdued and was released when Lily came and stomped on the mushrooms.
- Malthos recalled that the mushrooms spoke to him in infernal, and told him that they knew where he was.
- You guys proceeded to travel a little more, where Ivan in bird form flew to get a better view of the jungle and pointed out he found a small ziggurat at the top of a nearby cliff.

## Nightfall at Camp
- Any further traveling incurs a point of exhaustion
- Ivan Asks Lily for the Red Mushrooms to make into healing potions
- Ivan states, "They are valuable, and I'd like to show you why"
- Ivan states that he can teach her how with more basic materials back at camp, She will need an herbalism kit. 
- Ivan Makes as many healing potions as he can. A healing potions requires 2 red amanita mushrooms and 8 hours time and a 15 on a medicine check.
- Whoever is on watch witnesses Newton, Maeglin, and Fritters appear before them. Fritters says, "This doesn't look right". Newton says, "There has been a miscalculation." "Maeglin says, I'll say. Lets try this" and pulls out a forked rod with what looks like diamonds at the end of it and creates a portal and they all step through

## For Each Square (same as session4)

- Necrotic T Rex moves in a d8 direction. Players can track it's last 2 squares.

## Dead City

The players precede the ziggurat by encountering a clearing within the jungle. That clearing exhibits a large amount of rubble and mossy stone. There are many walls standing alone, very few roofs. Some of the walls still exhibit ornate carvings and sculptures, mostly cartoonish stylings of monkeys, snakes, large cats, and large reptilian beasts. Occasionally human remains are found, all skeletal, and rarely in tact. The dead were clearly disturbed by something here. 
- There is a stream that runs through the path of the city, originating from what you can clearly see to be a ziggurat, and also the tallest point of the hill. 
- There is a large pit dug with a mass amount of human remains. It looks hastily made, and there are no markers of the dead
- Oddly enough, there is a more formal cemetery with small stones with runes for markings close by.
- There is some local fauna (monkeys, snakes, colorful birds) in the deserted city.
- There are identifiable work benches and the occasional altar that look small - maybe for personal use in homes of the people.
- There is plant life growing out of the ruins (roll on the plant table for more info)

Ivan notes that this makes him unneasy and he's not sure what to make of it.

A high perception check allows you to see eyes for just a split second, before vanishing into the jungle.

## The Ziggurat

Players notice a small ziggurat. The front of the pyramid has a staircase with an obvious entrance at the top of the pyramid. 
- Atop the Ziggurat is a set of doors that have been opened and mostly destroyed, revealing a room with a small altar and bits of human fingers litter the room.
- Just beyond the alter is a set of stairs that descend into darkness.
- The stairs descend about 20 steps before curling and landing down a narrow hallway.

The Walls:
- The walls are overrun by vines and dirt but when looked at closely with a light, you can see heiroglyphs that portray a bustling city, where there are clear rulers exaulting themselves above the beasts of the jungle (DM NOTE: shows their ignorance to outside human life).

### Challenge 1:
Trap: 
- Obvious spike trap. 
- D10 athletics to dodge
- if failed, take 2d6 damage

### Challenge 2:

Trap:
- Looks like a triggered pitfall. There is no hiding it, The ground has crumbled making no easy path across
- There is a long board on the other side leaning from the floor, signalling that permitted personel would bring a plank to cross the pitfall
- If attempted to jump, the DC is a 10 athletics to get across
- if failed take 3d8 damage

Walls:
At the End of the hallway a similar set of stairs appear and curl going the other way now. The next set of heiroglyphs show a group of men presenting the people of the city amazing gifts. Gold, jewels, etc. The people then bowed down to these men.

Make a roll:
- A Group of American Gunslingers are in the temple. 
- The gunslingers make a roll for perception which must beat the party's stealth. If they aren't stealthing, must beat a 10.
- The gunslingers roll a stealth role if they detect the party and hide their torchlight.

The Stairs: 
- The tunnel looks trap free but as you progress the place looks progressively overgown and is crawling with spiders and centipedes. 
- The players run into a set of stairs that progress deeper into the temple

### Challenge 3: 

If the americans are hiding, they jump out of the darkness and tell everyone to drop their weapons and put their hands in the air. If they don't, one of the americans fires a shot at the closest person and initiatives are rolled. 

The map breaks into a cross of 4 pathways, the one the players are coming from, and 3 options (straight, left, right). 2 of the paths (straight and right) have pitfalls, both already triggered. The idea is the same for challenge 2. Those paths eventually meet a deadend. The left path has an obvious spike trap like challenge 1. 

- If talking to the Americans, the americans are hostile to any hint at socialism.
- They are looking for an artifact that can help them get off this plane. They captured a jungle person and beat them until they got a hint of a rumor that something like that exists.
- Asks for any information regarding it.
- If asked where they came from, they declare that that information is classified and cannot be disclosed.
- If asked who they work for or anything of that nature, they do not give up that information. 

### Challenge 4: 

The Door:
- The players face a rather ornate door that is overgrown with vines and bugs, but gems stick out from underneath.
- The carving on the door depicts a woman suspended in the air being drained of blood from her stomach and draining down into a goat-man's mouth

The Puzzle:
- If they proceed through the left path, the room opens up and A set of 6 cobra shaped levers that when pulled on their own don't do anything and when released, release a noxious gas that causes damage in a 5 foot square for the next minute or so and it needs time to fade. Players standing in an affected square take 5d6 poison damage whenever they start their turn there.
- When the levers are all pulled at the same time the ornate clicks and is now able to be opened.

The Stairs:
- When The door is opened, They are presented with a staircase that descends deeper into the darkness. The walls are now crawling with vile bugs that you've never seen before.
- (the isolated environment has allowed for some strange mutation)

 ### Challenge 5:

The Walls: 
- Murral with heiroglyphics that basically show the jungle people with boils and disease and they're being exterminated for it. Some show people removing the diseased parts of themselves. 
- The rest of the people show praising the royalty and building the ziggurat. 

The Casket:
- Crawling with vines
- The casket in the middle of the room depicts the goat man hold on a bowl.
- The goat is wearing a large amulet and within the amulet is pictures of the heavens (planets, stars, etc.)
- Perception check: The bowl is carved and is slightly concave compared to the rest of the carving.
- The tomb is sealed by magical means and is unlocked by blood. 
- Can be dispelled or disentegrated.
- If opened without sacrificing blood an audible dark cloud emits from the coffin. Players must make a constitution DC of 14 or be diseased.
- Needs strength checks adding up to 30 to move the casket lid.

Inside the Casket:
- A man with a broken chain around his neck where an amulet would go
- The Glaive is across his chest, the bead and the potion are within his clothes.
1. Potion of invulnerability. 
1. A Bead of Force.
1. A +2 glaive 

The Glaive:
- The pole is made of ivory, as if carved from a huge tusk. 
- In the carvings are a series of runes. Appears to be in two different languages.
- In celestial it reads: 
- In infernal it reads: Woe to those who love their fleshly vessel. Release them of their faulty consciousness.

The Disease:
- If anyone was diseased, The next day they suffer a point of exhaustion. In 1d4 days they suffer another point until healed. They break out in visible boils.
