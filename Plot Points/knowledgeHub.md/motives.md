## Ivan
- Ivan prays warning Mielikki that Talona is gaining the jungle, as it is largely ungaurded.
- Ivan's true purpose was to watch the northern part of the jungle for intruders.
- Ivan expects to find others like him, other followers of Mielikki.
- The sirenic demon gained knowledge of them through the innocence of the mushrooms and found a way to destroy them.
- Ivan respects the life of the jungle people but believes there hearts are too easily corrupted but is hopeful they can respect the Jungle and the proper cycle of life once again.


## Talona
- ultimately talona is trying to create fertile land to create a poison farm where she will raise an army and harvest the planet and bring destruction to the world.
- Mielikki is waging a war against Talona elsewhere and is losing heavily and is unable to aid.
- The sirenic demons were a most fruitful harvest of Talona's and are used as maximal weapons that act as plane harvesters.
- Talona gained help from a demonic influence for her crop.

## Jungle People
- The Jungle people have made a pact with the Talona and worship the Plane Harvester and sacrifice to it out of pure fear.
- By complying, and assisting, they are granted immunity from disease and can live prosperously... in fear.
