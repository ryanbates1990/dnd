# DM Notes

# Session start
- Players awake refreshed, clothes still semi-damp, in little oak
- Squirt lets them know that when they've accomplished this task, that he can escort them to Yon, they just need to find little oak or the players take him with them.
- As you leave you realize little oak has moved about a little bit and you 
- Will returns as the characters are leaving 
> "There you are little oak, don't give up on me so fast, I was worried! Good thing you're easy to track down", Little Oak gives a deep sigh of relief.
- says he was pursued by redcaps, may be coming here. Doesn't know where the other kids are, inquires about the player's status.
- Luke's character is in the middle of a fairy circle nearby.
- The characters are now in an area on the other side of LoomLurch (the side by the garden).

# Approaching Loomlurch
- The players notice ravens (DC 18 they have letters attached to them) flying from a tower in loomlurch.

# Changes
- Destroyed part of her kitchen, workshop, destroyed some of the tin men that were in charge of guarding the outside.
- Remaining guards are on edge, boggles are shyer than usual
- The portrait now has a glyph of warding which can be detected using an investigation DC of 14. If touched, cold fills the room and all in it take 5d8 cold damage or half (DC 14 Dex Save)
- Goblin Market is temporarily closed, however, chucklehead is sitting on the ground clutching his head muttering incoherently.

## Things Elkhorn knows
- Part of an adventuring party called Valor's call. We came to track down the League of Malevolence, a crew that has been committing heinous crimes on other planes. We believed they were here, and sought to create an alliance with Zybilna to bring them down.
- We came in contact with the League of Malevolence in the palace of hearts desire and we fought in glorious battle. The next thing I remember though is waking up here. 
- Skabatha interviewed me but she seems to have lost interest and forgot about me. Left me here to die. I gave her a piece of my mind when she dropped you guys off though don't get me wrong.
- Every once in a while Mishka would come down and say hi and give me a piece of bread to me going, if I get out of here I want to save each and every one of these children.

## Valor's Call
- Strongheart
- Mercion
- Ringleron
- Elkhorn
- Mollivor

## Where is Skabatha?

- She has taken to her bedroom for an early rest.

## What kids are in what rooms?

# The Kitchen (L13)

- Doors to L14 and L15 (study and outside) are locked

> This squalid kitchen is carved out of the trunk of the fallen oak. A large clay oven sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by crowded shelves laden with forest fungi, jars of pickled grubs, animal skulls, and moldy cookbooks. Sickly-sweet vapors emerge from a cauldron that rests atop the oven.

> A young human girl shackled to a worktable is hard at work peeling potatoes. A green dragon the size of a large dog is coiled up near the oven, apparently dozing, Fumes rise from the wyrmling's nostrils.

## Children 
- Mishka (a 9-year-old female human) serves Granny Nightshade as a scullery maid. Mishka has managed to escape from Loomlurch twice, only to be tracked down by Cradlefall and recaptured both times; that's why Granny Nightshade now chains her to the worktable. 

- As an action, a character using thieves' tools can pick the lock on Mishka's ankle cuff with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Any key that unlocks the kitchen doors also unlocks Mishka's chains. If done so, she shares the password that unlocks Granny Nightshades dollhouse (FizzleBuzz)

If Skabatha isn't present, Mishka tells the characters about the hag's daily routine and describes Granny Nightshade's minions (see Where's Skabatha? and " Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter). She suggests that they lure Granny Nightshade into the oven and burn her up.

## Oven
- Large enough to cook medium creatures. 5 foot wide iron door. If someone peers inside, can see the coal-black eyes of a fire elemental (who can't be targeted while it is trapped in the oven)
- Any creature that enters the hot oven or starts its turn inside it takes 10 (2d6 + 3) fire damage. A character can try to shove a Medium or smaller creature into the oven, if the creature is within 5 feet of the oven's open door (see " Shoving a Creature" in the Player's Handbook). If the creature is looking into the oven when it is shoved, the Strength (Athletics) check to shove the creature is made with advantage.

## Cookbooks. 
Granny Nightshade has several cookbooks in her kitchen that contain candy recipes. One of these books has a 1-foot-long piece of gnarled root as a bookmark; this object is the cutting that Granny Nightshade took from the shambling mound in area L5.

## Treasure. 
Searching Granny Nightshade's kitchen reveals the following treasures:
1. Six brass egg cups embossed with the faces of crying children (5 gp each)
1. An ornate eight-minute hourglass (75 gp)
1. A moldy wooden coffer labeled "Mushrooms" (in Elvish) that contains two butterfly saddles and a hummingbrella (see area L5 for descriptions of these mushrooms)
1. In addition, Elkhorn's shield and +1 longsword can be found inside a small cupboard.

# Family Tree (L11)
- Door to L6 (outside) is locked.

> This room has three doors and a wood-carved staircase that ascends to a higher level. The walls are a dense tangle of tree roots and brambles, nestled among which are five animated portraits: one of a svelte, dark-haired woman and the others depicting hags.

- A truly ancient and terrifying hag (Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches)
- A toadish hag (Bavlorna Blightstraw, as depicted in appendix B)
- A skeletal hag wearing a black, theatrical contraption resembling a dress (Endelyn Moongrave, as depicted in appendix B)
- A hag with a wind-up key in her back, one empty eye socket, and a wooden eye held in her hand (Skabatha Nightshade, as depicted in appendix B)
- A svelte, dark-haired woman with a commanding presence (her appearance matching that of the Tasha mannequin outside the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival, as described in chapter 1)

## The Portraits
The portraits are enchanted to display the last creature that pricked its skin on the brambles' thorns in addition to its four closest family members, if it has any. These family members can be living or dead. (If the creature has fewer than four close family members, any remaining portraits are blank.) Each portrait magically animates to create the impression that the subject is looking around and shifting uncomfortably, but the animation has the quality of an old movie. The moving images are silent.

## Pricking Thorns. 
Any creature that reaches toward a portrait must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pricked by the thorny brambles. The prick deals no damage, but the portraits change to match the pricked creature and up to four of its closest family members.

# Textile Mill (L12, upstairs from the Portraits)
> Three large, freestanding looms dominate this chamber. A young goblin and a pair of gnome children work the machines, filling the room with a loud, rhythmic clatter. A door is set in the opposite wall, and an archway to the east leads to a storeroom.

- one of the doors leads to a balcony where 2 tin soldiers patrol area L6.
- there are 3 boggles playing pranks (a hand coming out of the rift to provoke, objects coming out, oil, etc.)

## Children
- Yvelda (8 year old female goblin)
- Callybon (an 11 year old female forest gnome)
- Callybons brother, Pogo (a 9 year old male forest gnome)

They are eager to escape Loomlurch but won't converse with strangers until the area is cleared of boggles.

## What do they know?
- Yvelda knows a scret route into Skabatha's bedroom. Climb outside the storeroom window, clamber across branches that grow out of the upright trees and pass above the kitchen area. From there you can hop onto the windowsill of the hag's bredroom. (Requires DC 13 dexterity check, failed save falls off the room taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage).
- Yvelda, in the hag's private quarters, witnessed Pud (another child in L8) reporting something to the hag.

## Treasure (searching the store room, a closet attached to the mill)
- A pouch holding 35 sp (the coins' mintage is unfamiliar to the characters)
- A small, leather-bound book containing delicate sketches and watercolor paintings of pixies, sprites, and other Fey (50 gp)

# Cupbords (L10, attached to the Portrait Room)
> Moths cluster around a lantern that hangs from the ceiling in the middle of a hallway, casting flitting shadows on the walls. The hall contains three sliding doors along the walls, and a heavier hinged door stands at the opposite end.

The three cupboards, accessed by sliding the doors open, hold workshop supplies, boxes of junk, and other mundane bric-a-brac

If they look furhter they may find 1d4 tinkets  
1. Tiny hourglass without sand in it
1. 	Pumpkin cupcake that magically regenerates itself in its paper cup each day at dawn
1. 	Pinwheel whirligig that spins even when there's no wind
1. Set of false wooden teeth

## Large Cupboard. 
Sowpig stands in the middle of the largest cupboard, silent and unmoving. She is a Small ghoul with 17 (5d6) hit points. Moths that live in the cupboard have encased Sowpig's body in silk. Opening the cupboard door releases a swarm of moths, which is harmless and always moves toward the nearest light source. Any space that it occupies is lightly obscured.

After the swarm has been released, Sowpig emerges from her silk cocoon to ask why she has been disturbed. The ghoul assumes that the characters are Granny Nightshade's workers, sent to fetch her for a new task.

Elkhorn's sword and shield along with your missing materials are in boxes just beyond the sowpig, there is also the unicorn horn.

# Dormitory (above the barracks, L8)

> This dormitory nestles in the tree boughs and has round windows overlooking a wooden balcony. Lining the walls are ten child-sized bunks outfitted with patchwork quilts and straw-stuffed pillows.

>A young male dwarf lies in one of the bunks, coughing and drenched in sweat, while an older lad mops his brow with water from a bucket. Two doors exit the room: one leads to a balcony, the other deeper into the tree.

## Children
- Pud (12 year old human boy) - the snitch that Yvelda won't speak to
- Brottor (10 year old hill dwarf) who has been poisoned and fell gravely ill after eating an nightshade from the garden. 

Pud is responsible for getting Brottor better or until Brottor dies

> "Shhh, be quiet" as he points to the balcony and you can see two tin soldiers parolling the balcony overlooking the garden.

Characters who are suspicious of Pud can make a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check; on a successful check, a character discerns that Pud is untrustworthy. (In fact, he's deciding whether to betray the characters to the hag.)

If one or more characters are mean to him, Pud slips off at the first opportunity to alert Skabatha, hoping that his loyalty to her will pay off for him in the future.

## Curing Brottor. 
Any effect that neutralizes poison can cure Brottor. If the characters lack the means to cure Brottor on their own, they can use hummingbrella mushrooms (found in areas L5 and L13) to neutralize the poison.  

If his ailment remains untreated, the dwarf falls into a coma after 5 hours. A character who administers to the dwarf for 1 hour and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check can delay the onset of the coma for an additional 1d4 + 1 hours.

If the characters save Brottor's life, Pud silently vows not to betray them to the hag.

## Treasure. 
Characters who search the dormitory uncover the following valuable items:
1. A silver bookmark shaped like a feather (5 gp)
1. A gold signet ring depicting a weeping willow (25 gp)
1. A cracked bloodstone (25 gp) stuffed inside a pillowcase

# Sewing Room (L9, on the ground, next to the Barracks)
A closed, unlocked door connects this room to a 5-foot-high wooden balcony that overlooks Granny Nightshade's garden (area L5).

> "Useless Welp!" cries a scratchy voice as you enter this cluttered chamber. "Those tatty sleeves wouldn't serve as socks for a chicken. Start again!"

> A plump halfling boy and a young, fluffy bugbear sit at work benches, watched over by a living, child-sized doll with buttons for eyes. An animated carpet prances around the children, who pay it no attention. The sewing room contains rolls of fabric, bobbins of thread, knitting needles, and pincushions.

## Children. 
- Wendel (an 11-year-old male strongheart halfling)
- Roff (a 10-year-old female bugbear). 

Roff recently stole a pouch of dust of corrosion (see appendix A) from the store cupboard in area L10. She conceals the pouch in her clothing and offers it to her saviors if rescued from the tyranny of Pincushion and the rug.

## Pincushion
Characters can plainly see a loop that holds a set of keys from Pincushion's waste.

Materials for the workshop are sewn here under the watchful gaze of Pincushion, a living doll (see appendix C for its stat block). The prancing carpet is a rug of smothering that defends Pincushion and keeps strangers away from the children. Pincushion carries a key that locks and unlocks the doors to the kitchen (area L13). The key dangles from a hoop attached to its waist.

The living doll challenges intruders and demands to know why they're trespassing here. To satisfy it, a character must succeed on a **DC 10 Charisma** (Deception) check. On a failed check, Pincushion hollers for the tin soldiers at area L7. If satisfied, Pincushion asks the characters to wait here while it hurries to notify Skabatha of the newcomers' presence. The rug stays behind to make sure the children don't leave. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Pincushion.

## Treasure. 
Once the living doll leaves or is defeated, the characters can search the sewing room for treasure, finding the following valuable items:

1. A spool of barbed, golden yarn (15 gp)
1. Three bolts of silk in shades of putrid green and cesspit brown (10 gp each)
1. A set of five painted thimbles depicting poisonous Feywild plants (25 gp for the set)

## Workshop
Door to outside is locked.

> Flickering lanterns illuminate a cluttered workshop filled with soft, ambient music produced by bells and chimes. Parts of toys are heaped on the tables—leering doll's heads, half-built rocking horses, unpainted wooden balls, and the stuffed limbs of soft toys. A stove at the back of the room holds a saucepan of smelting metal. Three doors exit the workshop, and two storefront windows overlook the market outside.

> Three young children are gathered around a wooden worktable. The eldest, a drow boy, prances on the tabletop with a bar of soap in one hand, while a halfling girl and a human girl giggle at his audacity.

> Looking Bereft there is another child, Obi, sadly looking at his hands wondering how he has come back to this horrible place.

## Children
- Naal (11 year old male drow) - stole a kitchen key from Pincushion. He took an impression of it using a bar of soap before fastening the key back to pincusion's belt. He just wants milk from the kitchen.
- Sung (9 year old female human)
- Philomena (8 year old female halfing) - Weeps if she is forced to leave without her piglet, Oink, who is in the pigpen in area L5.

They have been here longer than any can remember, here they do not age.

## Treasure. 
Characters who ransack the workshop uncover the following valuables:
1. A jar of iridescent glass eyes (10 gp)
1. A silver hammer and chisel in a green leather tool belt (15 gp for the set)
1. Iron metalworking tongs shaped like the jaws of a snapping dragon (15 gp)
