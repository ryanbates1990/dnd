# Adventure Start

> It's a late summer evening, the air is starting to cool to a comfortable temperature just outside the city of Tresmouth. The sky is a blend of oranges, reds, and purples. Ahead of you is the faint sound of music, crowds, and the whirring and buzzing of rides and carnival games. 

> The Witchlight Carnival visits your world once every eight years. You have a dim memory of sneaking into the carnival as a child without paying for a ticket. That memory has grown foggy over time, though it still conjures a weird admixture of emotions—wonder and awe mixed with loss and regret. During this childhood visit, your character lost something. You tried to find it, but the carnival owners—a pair of elves named Mister Witch and Mister Light—were decidedly unhelpful.

> "Silly little screeching cricket," said Witch. "You forgot to buy a ticket."

> "The carnival goes round and round," said Light. "The multiverse is our playground. Nothing's free and nothing's lost. Every visit has its cost."

> As time passed, your heart became less heavy, and you gave less and less thought to those childhood events. Now, for reasons you can't explain, the longing to retrieve that which you have lost has resurfaced, as though an old spell has faded away, allowing you to feel the loss as sharply as if it happened yesterday.

> The Witchlight Carnival has returned, and you find yourself standing near a ticket booth by the entrance at twilight, just as the carnival is about to open. There you meet others who look as troubled as you. Without knowing how or why, you sense that each of them has lost something as well. Perhaps fate has brought you together.

# The Carnival

> The first stars of night twinkle above the apricot sunset. As you walk down the path towards the carnival you start to notice Giant dragonflies whir overhead, trailing streamers, and a low mist curls over the ground. Through a floral archway, you glimpse wondrous and vibrant creatures—elf stilt walkers, dancing faeries, and painted performers. Everywhere there is laughter, pixie dust, bubbles, and the wistful tune of a whistling calliope.

# Ticket Booth

> A silver statue of a dancing faerie is mounted on the roof of this ticket booth and surrounded by fluttering butterflies. The booth is decorated with an animated depiction of the night sky, with shooting stars arcing across it.

> An elderly goblin perches behind the ticket counter, peering at you quizzically through a spyglass. He lowers the spyglass and calls out to you: "Greetings, fair fairgoers!"

- Nikolas Midnight, old wrinkled goblin
- Under the ticket counter is an ornate wooden box with a silver clasp and the monogram N.M. It contains one prepaid ticket for each visiting character. 
- tickets were purchased by Ellywick Tumblestrum, but Tumblestrum has asked Nikolas not to divulge this information. Instead, Nikolas claims that these tickets were paid for by "an anonymous benefactor.
- Nikolas explains that each ticket is good for eight attractions; characters who want to sample more of the carnival's offerings must buy another ticket. Most attractions in the carnival have a cost of 1 ticket punch. After the eighth punch, a ticket becomes a worthless keepsake.
- Any visitor who can't afford the price of a ticket or who doesn't want to pay for a ticket can make a fey pact with Nikolas instead

## Nikolas Midnight
- carries a spyglass and an ear horn, which he uses when talking to patrons
- Nikolas plays on the fact that he is old when using these items, but it's all a ruse; he is as sharp as a thorn, and his instruments allow him to get the true measure of guests. In his hands, the spyglass and ear horn grant Nikolas advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern lies and determine true intent. Characters who attempt to deceive Nikolas must succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the goblin's Wisdom (Insight) check.
- If one or more characters seem intent on disrupting the carnival, Nikolas scribbles a brief note to that effect and hands it to an invisible pixie that lurks under the ticket counter. The pixie delivers Nikolas's message to Mister Witch, who informs the carnival staff to keep a close eye on the group, and the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step 

# Upon Entering the Carnival
 > You see a potbellied man, a carnival employee known as a witchlight hand, in colorful overalls and fake red wings carrying a tray of rainbow colored cotton candy and from up in the sky swoops down a giant dragonfly! It careens toward the ground but pulls up last second, it's rider spilling his frothy drink that rains down on the worker and soaks him and his tray of candy. Onlookers laugh jovially and you see one particular person in the crowd as they are laughing, their head turns into a donkey's and lets out a (hee haw donkey noise) and then quickly returns to his normal self. The crowd's amusement escalates even more and is hysterical. 

 > As you scan the crowd you notice someone handing out maps, "Know where you're going, know where you've been, know where you're headed,  and go right in! Get a map right here on me!"

 > Don't forget the Big Top Extravaganza at hour 4 and the Witchlight Crowning at hour 8!

# Northwind (and red)'s entrance
> A twelve-foot-tall walking tree garlanded in golden ribbons marches down the thoroughfare. Emerald clouds swirl above the tree and rain down golden, spinning sycamore seeds. Fairgoers try to catch the seeds before they hit the ground. As the seeds gently fall, a chatty squirrel scampers along the boughs of the tree, handing dandelions to select passersby.

- Red hands the characters one dandelion apiece and encourages each of them to make a wish and then blow the dandelion's seeds into the air.

- **Catching Sycamore Seeds**: DC 10 Dexterity checks. Persuade them to go to the welcome gifts stall

- **Dandelion**: write down their character's wish on a piece of paper.

# Big Top Extravaganza (Timed Event)

- Put on the music from the cirque de soleil

>The lights dim and a hush falls over the crowd. A second later, a spotlight illuminates a lithe, elven figure sitting in a silver hoop, suspended above the center ring by silk ropes. The elf wears a dazzling suit of diamond-pane mirrors and a pair of butterfly wings. His scepter is topped with a spinning vane.

>"Welcome, one and all, to this evening's extravaganza! I am Mister Light. Prepare to be delighted!"

- Describe in detail the performances.
- Over the course of an hour, Burly the bugbear performs feats of strength, Palasha the mermaid serenades the audience from a clamshell bathing pool, Candlefoot the mime plays silent games with audience members, and faerie dragons with bright streamers tied to their tails perform dazzling acts of synchronized flying as a troupe of acrobats, clowns, and fire-breathers parade about.
- If the characters attempt to disrupt the show, Mister Light deflects their interruptions with banter and maintains a jovial demeanor. Persistent heckling lowers the carnival's mood by 1 step

> Mr Light: "We hope you've been dazzled and delighted by our wonderful performers. That's all we had prepared for this evening but we want keep the show going! If anyone believes they can wow the audience and grace us with their wonderful talent, PLEASE step forward and show us what magic or might you may posess!" He performs a welcoming bow gesturing that anyone is welcome to come down and put on a show.

- Any character who accepts the offer can woo spectators with a DC 14 Charisma (Performance) check, raising the carnival's mood by 1 step on a success. If multiple characters choose to perform together, make it a group check instead, but raise the carnival's mood by 3 steps if the group check succeeds. A character can improve the carnival's mood only once during this extravaganza.

# Resources and other activities

### Sneaking Inside
> The carnival issues fake butterfly wings to every visitor who receives a ticket. Visitors are expected to wear their wings, or at least carry them around, while inside the carnival. The tickets and fake wings are theirs to keep.

> Any character who tries to sneak into the carnival without a set of fake butterfly wings must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be spotted and approached by 1d3 Witchlight hands of any alignment (see the stat block earlier in the chapter). The hands ask to see the character's ticket; any character without a ticket is escorted to the main entrance and directed to the ticket booth. If the character runs away from the Witchlight hands, the hands don't bother giving chase, but the carnival's mood lowers by one step (see " Tracking Mood" earlier in this chapter). A character without butterfly wings who successfully sneaks into the carnival must repeat the check at the end of each hour.

### Random Events

- Two girls in face paint (a lion and a hart) squabble over a painted wooden crown that their mother won at a stall.
- A satyr with red-and-white-striped horns plays the pipes while leading a procession of dancing rodents.
- An elf stilt-walker tosses colorful sugary treats down to children who pass by.
- A painted sign of an elf wearing a jester's hat springs to life and exclaims, "We hope you're having a delightful evening!"
- With a puff of glitter, a man's head suddenly turns into the head of a braying donkey, to the giggling delight of a group of mischievous pixies.
- Giant, singing flowers burst from the ground and serenade passersby.
- A lively jig springs up, led by a troupe of gnomish clowns.

### Games (Small Stalls around the carnival)

- Almiraj Ring Toss
- Catch the Dragon by the Tail
- Goblin Wrestling
- Guess the Number of Feathers
- Outstare the Cyclops

### Theft and Violence
- Characters who are caught stealing or fighting are asked to leave the carnival; in this case, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step as 1d6 Witchlight hands (chaotic good; see the stat block earlier in the chapter) escort the troublemakers to the gates.

### Thieves of the Coven

- **Reference**: https://5e.tools/adventure.html#wbtw,1,witchlight%20hands

> **No Ticket**. The thief targets one carnival guest it can see within 5 feet of it. If the target doesn't have a ticket, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. It retains no memory of events that occur while it is stunned in this way. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to this particular thief's No Ticket ability for the next 24 hours.

> **Sticky Fingers**. The thief targets one stunned creature it can see within 5 feet of it and steals one item weighing 10 pounds or less from that creature. Whatever it steals disappears, reappearing in the space of the hag to which the thief is beholden.
