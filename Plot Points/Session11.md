# Awakened Giant Goats
The characters come upon three giant goats, each of which has received the benefit of an awaken spell, raising its Intelligence score to 10 and granting it the ability to `speak Elvish`. These goats have silvery-gray fur, wizened faces, and golden, hourglass-shaped pupils that observe the characters closely.

The goats have the ability to hear prophecies and secrets whispered on the wind. Upon seeing the characters, the goats bleat the following:

1. The first goat says, "When the moon obstructs the sun, Creeping Lyn will come undone." (This prophecy refers to Endelyn's weakness, as described in appendix B.)
1. The second goat says, "Play to her passions. Stay on script. A cat, a horn, or a shadow ripped." (This prophecy refers to Endelyn's desire to have plays performed for her and the three things she's willing to accept as the result of any bargain made with the characters, as discussed in "Bargaining with Endelyn" section later in the chapter.)
1. The third goat says, "The fool's scepter is the key." (This statement refers to the scepter that belongs to Stagefright the goblin, which can be used to open the stone door to area M17.)

After speaking these words, the goats wait to see if the characters offer them something in return, thereby honoring the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2). The goats are hungry but not picky eaters, though they admit to being fond of root vegetables. If no reciprocation is forthcoming, either in the form of food or other gifts, all three goats bolt away as a galeb duhr erupts from the ground beneath them. This Elemental can't speak and is a manifestation of the Feywild's anger toward the characters. It attacks the party and fights until destroyed. There are plenty of boulders in the area that the galeb duhr can animate using its Animate Boulders action.

# Choice

> You guys take a moment to realize your situation. You are high in the mountains and there are loose makings of trails that zig zag back and forth. In fact you are on the top of a mountain and you can see you can scale the mountain up and down if you did enough finagling. As you set your sites to the horizon you see Motherhorn, the castle perched somewhat precariously on the side of a sister mountain. It dawns on you that this mountain may be difficult to get to by walking alone.

> As you scan your surroundings trying to discern what to do next you guys notice a couple of things. One that on the current mountain you are on, a ways up, following the peak, is a faint glow. The other is, you can hear a sound that sounds like a foot in a gravel road, but it doesn't stop. It persists like a long, crunchy humm. This sound is coming from the side of the mountain and a little farther up, but you don't see anything.

# Lockbury Henge

**Before the players arrive** a howling wind warns Queen Argantle and her cousin Jagu of the party's arrive. They stomp out the campfire and meld into stone into the nearby henges, leaving a game of Crowns (chess like game) unfinished.

>Atop a boulder-strewn plateau stands a circle of eight megaliths. In the center of this henge, a small, checkered game board with stone playing pieces rests on the ground near the dying embers of a campfire. Each of the eight standing stones is about 20 feet tall and hewn from a different kind of rock: shale, chalk, flint, granite, slate, basalt, obsidian, and marble

- Argantle is Hiding in Shale
- Jagu is Hiding in Chalk

Characters who examine the campfire and succeed on a **DC 12 Wisdom (Survival)** check notice two sets of small, sooty hoofprints leading up to the stones where the korreds are hiding.

Argantle and Jagu emerge from their megaliths if the characters properly finish the korreds' game of Crowns (see "Game Board" below). If the characters ruin the game, deface the standing stones, or otherwise irritate the korreds, Argantle and Jagu emerge from their megaliths and attack the characters for their insolence. Otherwise, the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) prevents the korreds from harming the characters. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Argantle.

**Argantle** is a Deep gray, small, humanoid creature. She looks like a dwarf made of stone, but has hooved feet rather than toes. She has a thinner profile and is less stocky than a dwarf and is adorned with deep gray scaly armor that shines looks to me made of obsidian. It is ornate and beautiful and her hair is long and braided and looks to be made of iron.

"You trespass travelers. State your purpose and to whom you do business"

**Jagu** is similar but is stockier and pale in appearance. He, being male, is stockier in appearance and his clothes look more like regular clothes, yet they still look like they are crafted from rock.

"If you know what's good for you I suggest you leave."

## DM Notes
> **Brigganocks and Korreds** The brigganocks who live under the mountains of Yon are at odds with the korreds who live on the slopes and peaks. Each group believes that the other is in league with Endelyn Moongrave, not realizing that the hag is a menace to both. The characters encounter the korreds at Lockbury Henge and the brigganocks at Brigganock Mine. For more information about these Fey creatures, see appendix C.

>If the characters discover that the brigganocks are not allied with Endelyn and convey this information to the korreds, Queen Argantle of the korreds promptly arranges a meeting with the brigganocks to sort out their differences. Similarly, if the characters convince the brigganocks that the korreds don't work for Endelyn, the brigganocks agree to meet the korreds outside the mine. After this meeting, the korreds and the brigganocks unite to aid the characters in Motherhorn (as described in the "Fey to the Rescue!" sidebar later in the chapter).

As an action, **Argantle can call forth the remaining six leaders** of the korred clans of Yon, each one emerging from its corresponding megalith. If combat breaks out, these six korreds help Argantle capture the characters for questioning. The other korred clan leaders are Budoc of Flint, Azil of Granite, Myzelda of Slate, Yanna of Basalt, Noll of Obsidian, and Malo of Marble.

**If the characters convince Argantle that they also consider the hag an enemy**, she reveals the following:

1. The korreds no longer hold large gatherings at Lockbury Henge. Argantle fears the consequences of Bitter End's meddling and has instructed her fellow korreds to ensconce themselves in stone, thus remaining in relative safety for the foreseeable future.
1. Bitter End used iron shears to cut off locks of Argantle's hair. The hag fashions korred hair into iron ropes and uses them to manipulate her theater's infernal contraptions.
1. Bitter End uses a contraption called the Orrery of Tragedies to glimpse all possible futures. Copper rods on the mountaintops of Yon capture lightning and channel it into this device.

## The Gameboard

An examination of the checkered board reveals that the pieces depict a game in progress. Two sets of playing pieces, one made of shale and the other of chalk, are sculpted in the form of tiny korreds (cloven-hoofed creatures with wild beards and hair). If the characters have already visited Brigganock Mine, they see that the game pieces resemble the leering statues outside the mine's entrance.

Characters who study the arrangement of the pieces on the board and succeed on a **DC 14 Intelligence (Insight)** check determine that Slate can beat Chalk in a single move. Making this move causes the victorious Queen Argantle to emerge from her stone, laughing and cheering. Jagu emerges grumpily to join her, chewing on pebbles and glaring at the characters.

Treasure. The character who helped Argantle win the game receives a gift, in accordance with the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2). Argantle picks up a lump of rock, squeezes it tightly between her hands to transform it into a star sapphire (1,000 gp), and gives it to the character. If the gift is accepted, the gemstone begins to glow faintly. Until it stops glowing 24 hours later, the star sapphire has the properties of a stone of good luck that doesn't require attunement.

## Distant Racket

Any conversation between the characters and the korreds is interrupted by a commotion:

> The korreds grind their teeth and stamp their hooves as the faint sound of pickaxes tapping on stone is carried to them on the wind. Queen Argantle runs to a boulder, picks it up, and hurls it a hundred feet in the direction of the noise while she screams, "Death to the brigganocks!" A peal of thunder accompanies this display of anger.

1. The brigganocks are helping Bitter End build wicked contraptions. They also hide and guard schematic diagrams for new contraptions in their mine. (The korreds are mistaken. The hag terrorizes the brigganocks and has kidnapped their chief architect, forcing him to work under duress in Motherhorn.)
1. The korreds can't stand the noise of the brigganocks' mining, so they craft statues and leave them outside the mine's entrance, hoping to frighten the brigganocks into leaving.
1. A galeb duhr working for the korreds infiltrated the mine and overheard several brigganocks talking about a secret tunnel that connects the mine to Motherhorn. The tunnel is hidden by brigganock magic.

## The Dance
If the players seem like they will help queen Argantle, out of elation she summons the other 7 tribe leaders who have musical accompanyment and dance endlessly.

# Briggannock Mine

>You hear the sound of hundreds of tiny pickaxes and hammers chipping away at stone. It emanates from the mouth of a cave that has fingers of rock reaching skyward above it. Statues of irate, hairy creatures with cloven hooves are positioned so that they lean around trees and peer over boulders, all staring balefully at the cave entrance

> As soon as you step inside the cave, the tapping noise stops.

The mine is a twisting labyrinth of 8-foot-high, 3-foot-wide tunnels that corkscrew into the ground (. The brigganocks made these tunnels big enough to accommodate ponies (which they use as beasts of burden) and their good friend Molliver)

- The characters encounter no brigganocks in the upper reaches of the mine, but the sound of activity persists
- After 10 minutes of navigating the mine, each character must succeed on a **DC 19 Constitution saving throw (Only Rhend)** or fall asleep for 1 hour, lulled into a magical slumber by the rhythmic racket of the miners. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this effect permanently. Elves and other creatures that can't be put to sleep by magic are also immune to the effect. Creatures that are put to sleep in this way can't be awakened early by any means short of a wish spell.
- Eight brigganocks (see appendix C) arrive 5 minutes later, each one pushing a tiny wheelbarrow that contains ropes and pitons. If they encounter party members who are still awake, the brigganocks look surprised, turn their wheelbarrows around, and retreat whence they came, passing Molliver as they return to the mine's depths (see "Molliver" below). Otherwise, if there's no one around to stop them, they use their Time Lapse action to rapidly pin sleeping party members to the floor using their hammers, pitons, and ropes.
- Creatures pinned to the floor are restrained, prone, and unable to stand up until they free themselves or are released by someone else. A creature can use an action to try to snap the ropes that bind it or to wriggle free of them, doing so with a successful **DC 16 Strength (Athletics)** check or **DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check**. If a creature has a knife or other sharp tool that it can reach while pinned to the floor, it can use an action to try to saw through its ropes, doing so with a successful **DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check**. A creature that gets free can use an action to release a creature that is still pinned (no ability check required).

> **Wish-Come-True** The brigganocks hail from a city called Wish-come-true, which is hidden deep beneath the mountains. Its buildings are adorned with glittering gems made from cut wish stones. Hidden behind thick rock walls and powerful illusions, the city can never be found by outsiders, nor can it be scried upon using divination magic.

## Molliver

> A tall, slender human clad in dark leather armor greets you, their friendly face brightly illuminated by a tiny wisp of light that floats next to a mouse-sized creature perched on the human's shoulder.

> "Greetings, trespassers," says the human with a smile. "Didn't anyone ever teach you how to knock?"

- the creature on Molliver's shoulder is Trig
- characters who have a **passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14** or higher notice two more brigganocks hiding on Molliver's person—one tucked comfortably in a belt pouch and the other peering over the rim of Molliver's left boot. Their names are Zarli and Oyla.
- The brigganocks are happy to have Molliver as their spokesperson and chief advisor when it comes to dealing with outsiders. Molliver has become embroiled in the brigganocks' quarrel with the korreds and assumes—as the brigganocks do—that the characters were sent by the korreds or their evil ally, Creeping Lyn, to slay brigganocks and steal wish stones
- The characters can convince Molliver of their true intentions with a successful **DC 9 Charisma (Persuasion) check**

## Moliver's information
1. Creeping Lyn kidnapped the brigganocks' best architect, Golmo, who now toils in Motherhorn, designing new contraptions for the hag.
1. The korreds provide Creeping Lyn with locks of their magic hair, which she uses to build her contraptions. (This is partially false. The hag cuts the korreds' hair without their consent; they are not her allies.)
1. The brigganocks work their mine at all hours because they know the noise aggravates the korreds.

Molliver dodges questions about how they came to be with the brigganocks but admits to being a member of Valor's Call, an adventuring group that has been hunting a pack of villains called the League of Malevolence. Molliver assumes that the other members of Valor's Call are safe at Zybilna's palace and is unaware of all that has happened there of late (see chapter 5). Knowing that their friends are in trouble doesn't change Molliver's desire to remain with the brigganocks, who need protection.

## Rivenwish Chasm
> After conferring with Trig, Molliver says that if the characters complete a test set before them, the brigganocks will show them a secret route to Motherhorn.
- To pass the test, the characters must cross Rivenwish Chasm, a gash in the earth into which the brigganocks hurl malignant wish stones (the ones born out of evil wishes). Molliver and their brigganock companions lead the characters through several tunnels that lead to the chasm but stop short of entering it:

> The route ends at a gaping chasm, on the far side of which is a grotto full of stalactites and stalagmites. A truss bridge constructed of intricate wooden struts and beams spans the one-hundred-foot gap across the chasm. Beneath the bridge is darkness dotted with purple lights.

> "Well," declares Molliver, "here we are at jolly old Rivenwish Chasm. Best stay on the bridge and not dillydally."

- The bridge is 5 feet wide, 100 feet long, and sturdy. Each 5-foot section of the wooden structure has AC 15, 30 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage.
- The chasm is haunted by three flameskulls—the remains of darklings who suffered from vertigo and fell to their doom before reaching the bridge's halfway point. The flameskulls hide under the bridge's midpoint. Characters who have passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of 10 or higher aren't surprised when the flameskulls emerge from hiding and take up positions 10 feet above the bridge.
- The flameskulls speak Elvish and Sylvan. Their names are Weaugh, Teaugh, and Peaugh
- convince the flameskulls to let the party pass, doing so with a successful **DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check**
- There's no chance of a character accidentally falling off the bridge or being knocked off the bridge by the flameskulls. The chasm is 200 feet deep, and its bottom is strewn with hundreds of malignant wish stones that give off purple light. These wish stones are unrefined lumps of crystal that shed bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet; any good-aligned creature that has one or more of them in its possession feels mildly nauseated, although this nausea has no game effect. Hags, liches, and other evil spellcasters can find macabre uses for these malignant wish stones, which otherwise have no value.

## Obud's Grotto

> In the center of the grotto is a piebald pony wearing blinders. A small wooden hut is strapped to its back, and a faint clatter can be heard from inside the hut.

- Obud is the oldest brigganock living in the mine. 
- The pony's name is Keg and houses Obud's hut.
- He dismounts the pony via a small rope.
- Obud appraises wish stones to assess their value.
- If someone knocks read:

> The door swings open, and a tiny, wrinkled creature hobbles into view, accompanied by a wispy bulb of light. The old brigganock peers at you through tiny spectacles and says in Common, "Big folk. How wonderful."

- Obud is old and tired, but neither too old nor too tired to show the characters hospitality. He welcomes them to his grotto, introduces them to Keg, and asks them why they've crossed the chasm to see him.
- If they inquire about the secret tunnel to Motherhorn, he says, "Ah, yes. Creeping Lyn's Theater of Terror. A dreadful place indeed." Obud suggests a trade: knowledge of the location of the tunnel in exchange for something that would benefit him and his fellow brigganocks.
- Ending the quarrel between the brigganocks and the korreds would suffice (see the "Brigganocks and Korreds" sidebar earlier in the chapter). Obud also accepts tasty food, including but not limited to sweets, a wheel of cheese, or a head of lettuce. Candy from the Witchlight Carnival or the goblin market in Loomlurch would suffice.

**Treasure.** Brigganocks shape and cut good wish stones into sparkling gems. Obud has three such gems in his hut, neatly laid out on a tiny rug. Two of the gems are worth 100 gp, and the third is worth 500 gp. Obud has appraised the gemstones and is waiting for their rightful brigganock owners to return and collect them. Stealing these gems violates the rule of ownership (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2). Characters who steal from Obud receive no further help from him.

# Tunnel to Motherhorn

A permanent illusion of a rock wall conceals an 8-foot-high, 3-foot-wide tunnel in the back wall of Obud's grotto. This secret tunnel leads to a storage room (area M12) beneath Motherhorn's stage. The illusory wall has no substance, which means that creatures and objects can pass right through it. A successful casting of dispel magic (DC 19) causes the illusory wall to disappear.

Obud informs the characters that Creeping Lyn is unaware of this tunnel's existence ("Let's keep it that way, aye?" he adds). The characters can return to the grotto through the tunnel whenever they want, provided they are on good terms with the brigganocks. If the characters use the tunnel without Obud's consent, brigganock miners spend the next 8 hours collapsing the tunnel on itself, preventing the characters from returning to the mine by that route.
