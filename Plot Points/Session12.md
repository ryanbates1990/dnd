# Summary

# Darklings
Minions of Motherhorn, cursed to abhor light for their ancestors betraying the Summer Queen long ago, know of a ritual that can heal them of their curse. However, to become an elder, the ritual can only work on a wise and respected darkling. If the ritual fails, the darkling dies. They are bound to servitude from Endelyn who has promised to use her oracular abilities to tell them when they can perform the ritual safely.

Do appreciate beauty, age and wrinkle when exposed to light. Currently appear as stunted, aged, ugly elves.

Remember she is overly dramatic in all that she does. Everything is a play and a performance and she can't be surprised. And she can react to every turn of combat.

Temporal Shunt can be used as a useful reaction against spell casters. However it can be avoided with a DC 15 wisdom save and uses a 5th level spell slot. This does waste the casters spell slot.

She can use Telekenesis to send 1 person over a cliff if they are within 30 feet of it. Range is 60 feet.

She can bestow curse which gives someone disadvantage on Charisma checks against her.

# Stagefright (The Players choose to perform)

If the players attempt to perform as part of a play they are approached by stagefright, who is a goblin boss

> A goblin in a jester's costume taps his clownish scepter on the floor to get your attention and says, "To impress the Dame of Unhappy Endings, you will need to perform a tragedyâ€”something gruesome, depressing, and darkly humorous. I have just the play!" A rolled-up script suddenly appears in his hand. "Normally we would have several hours to prepare, but alas, time is of the essence. Since you don't have time to memorize all the lines, we'll need to improvise." Tossing the script over one shoulder, he says, "Worry not! I'll feed you lines from the wings if you get stuck!"

If they continue, Stagefright gives the players each a role:
| d8 | Role |
|--------|--------|
|1|	Drunken satyr
|2	|Failed magician|
|3	|High-and-mighty princess|
|4	|Mean-spirited servant|
|5	|Nervous apothecary|
|6	|Cowardly noble|
|7|	Foolish minstrel|
|8|	Honorable knight risen from the dead|

Once all the characters have roles, Stagefright leads them to a prop storeroom (area M4a) and says, `"Find whatever you can make use of in this mess!"` The characters are allowed 20 minutes to don costumes and select props appropriate for their assigned roles. When they're ready, Stagefright leads them through the dressing room (area M5) to the performers' quarters (area M6), whereupon he says, "The play begins in ten minutes!" Characters can spend that time doing whatever they want. When the 10 minutes are up, Stagefright reappears and escorts the party to the stage (area M2).

Endelyn Moongrave (see appendix B) peers down at the stage from a 40-foot-high stone balcony (area M21) while a gloomy audience of darklings watches from the amphitheater seats and masked goblins perch atop the stage rigging (see the boxed text in area M2 for details). Stagefright introduces the characters' troupe and their play, then ducks behind a curtain. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Stagefright.

## Stagefright's lines are in Appendix E

- The players must ad-lib a tragedy. What their characters say and do is up to them for the most part, but they must find a way to incorporate Stagefright's lines into the play's dialogue. Each time a character delivers one of Stagefright's lines, that character's player draws a new line from the bag.
- Characters can freely move around the stage, use props, and enter and exit scenes as they wish, but every character who has a role must contribute to the performance.
- If one of the play's characters dies or meets some other tragic end, that character's player no longer draws lines of dialogue. A character who exits the story in this fashion can leave the stage but is expected to return and take a final bow once the play has concluded. Antics performed by offstage characters (including but not limited to the exploration of other areas in Motherhorn) should be resolved after the play concludes.

**Success.** If the characters earned more successes than failures, Endelyn is pleased to strike bargains with them. In addition, she invites them to stay in the theater as long as they like and make themselves at home; those who accept are assigned quarters in area M6.

**Failure.** If the characters netted more failures than successes, Endelyn is not entertained by their play and won't bargain with them. She orders the characters to leave her theater at once; if one or more of them refuse, she orders the darklings in the audience to attack. Characters who are reduced to 0 hit points in the ensuing fracas are knocked unconscious, then stripped of their gear and locked in the prison (area M17) until Endelyn decides how to punish them for wasting her precious time.
