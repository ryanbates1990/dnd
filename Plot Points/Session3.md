### June's Notebook

- Feverwood Trees: Notes that the large, elephant ear like leaves that fan at the top of the tree keeps the jungle quite dim allowing undergrowth that requires less sunlight.
- Sirenic Mycelium: Very pleasant mushrooms. I am quite drawn to these. They emit a strange glow and tend to grow closely to the base of feverwood trees. Strangely enough, feverwood trees without the mushroom nodes seem smaller and less healthy, suggesting a symbiotic relationship
- Gympie Plant: Stay away from these. Not interested in studying these.
- Red Amanita Mushroom: Rumored to be the prime ingredient in healing potions. Herb told me they grow best in decaying trees. Fortunately I have found a large area with dead feverwood trees. I'll note my findings later (draws a little heart)
- There is quite a number of Ferns and bushes that are drawn with not much interesting information. She does note that some taste good and has been chewing on them in attempt to use them as a salve or ointment with little luck.

### Herb and the Pestle and Mortar.

`Description`: 
- `Outdoors`: Small to Medium Cabin with an A-Frame roof extending far away from the frame of the house. Half of the roof is glass and has a retractable tarp on top. The outdoors is rather overgrown and wild in nature with vines and shrubbery but some of the wild is pretty with blossoming flowers. If at night, some of the foliage emits a light blue bioluminescence.
- `Indoors`: Plants everywhere and all sorts of glassware. Hanging fungi and chile's being dried in the sun from the glass rooftop. Potions in the back are in a glass case that are lit by small torches of bioluminescent material, some sort of fungus. 

- Sounds like Hank Hill
- Knew June and enjoyed her but wasn't best friends with her
- "I came here recently in attempt to open up my own shop. I've always loved plants and plant accessories, but my hometown just doesn't have the flora as the jungle. Admittedly my supply is low, I need to do my own research and development. Lucky for me there's these kids from Cloudspire looking for work! I uh, will also pay you for any interesting plants you'd like investigating yourself. I'll let you know it's properties. I can also teach you how to use your own herbalism and alchemical kit." 
- June wanted to work with Herb but Herb already had a gnomish intern named Jenny.
- Jenny is seen tinkering with a non descript leaf of the Jungle with a magnifying glass and bubbling beakers.
- Says he's experimenting with burnable incenses that have more potent effects that typical potions.

- "I haven't been in the jungle in a few days. Quite honestly I was spooked a bit. I was drawn further into the jungle because I noticed some of the plants weren't doing so hot. They were uh, diseased you know. And uh, I followed it and it only got worse! Gave me the heeby jeevies how bad the infestation was.. But then I saw some animals acting quite strangely. There was a large cat and a deer like thing. Their eyes were glazed over. Not eating one another like nature's way. Anyway I got the hell out of there." 


### Meeting Back up with Rodney and Mitch

- "So. Tell me, what kind of contraption was Kenny working out?"
- "How did you disable it?"
- "Well did you him out of it then? What did he say?"
- "What exactly did you do?"
- "Did the warehouse fire have anything to do with.... well... you guys? They say the fire originated in his office."

If the interaction goes poorly enough. Rodney suggests paying half of the original 220 gp.
