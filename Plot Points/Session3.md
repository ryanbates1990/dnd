# Summary
- You guys arrived in a strange swamp land you guys discovered is called Hither, a domain in Prismeer.
- You discovered a Faerie Dragon named Sir Talavar locked in a cage in a wicker basket along with a dead Bullywug attached to a deflated ballon atop a slanty tower. 
- He advised that a goblin named Jingle Jangle had a key that could free him and noted that she lives on Telemy Hill.
- The swamplands flooded leaving you guys up to your necks in water, but as luck would have it, you guys found a walking house which you guys swam to and entered.
- The house was a bar where you saw 2 barely conscious and drunk bullywugs and a lone bartender. You guys persuaded the bartender with a little coin to get the house to Telemy Hill.
- Upon arrival you guys talked briefly with a couple of awakened trees and entered Jingle Jangle's cave.
- She greeted you warmly, but looked beaten and bruised and told a tale of how she was beaten by the harengon gang while she was hunting for truffles.
- She told you the story behind her obsession with locks as well, which resulted in making a bad agreement with Bavlorna, the Hag, who lives in Downfall.
- She agreed to give you the key to free Sir Talavar which you did and he gave you his tiny sword.
- You guys agreed to enact revenge upon the Harengon gang for her
- Jingle Jangle provides you guys with comfortable lodging

# Session Begin (Jingle Jangle's House)
- You guys are safe in a small room and you guys and Jingle Jangle begins to exit the room to retire herself. Do any of you guys do anything before sleeping?

- Before leaving Jingle Jangle offers the following information:  

1. Agdon Longscarf is the leader of the harengon brigands. He wears a bright blue scarf and moves as fast as lightning. Characters who head toward Brigands' Tollway might encounter him there. You'll run into the Tollway on the way to Downfall

1. The best guide in Hither is a pincer-clawed scarecrow named Clapperclaw. It hangs around Downfall and knows the way to the neighboring realm of Thither, which is ruled by a hag named Granny Nightshade.

- As you guys leave, a group of awakened trees thanks you guys for being nice to Jingle Jangle and wishes you a nice day and farewell.
- You notice the water has dwindled and wat remains is a wet swampy area that you guys experienced when you first arrived to Hither.

# Gushing O'-Well
- You notice a giant well, about 10 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter gushing water about 30 feet high.

- Characters with a passive perception (or make a perception check) of 13 notice a couple small trinkets bobbing at the top of the geyser:
1. A rotten ogre's tooth with the Elvish glyph for "moon" etched into it
1. A small crystal orb that allows elve's to sleep
1. A mask (A bright purple blindfold ) that helps you remember your dreams if you wear it while you sleep (does not require attunement)

- The geyser is powerful enough to lift up to 300 pounds into the air, and the flow of water can be stopped if the well is covered by something weighing more than 300 pounds. If the water is prevented from erupting, anything being lifted by the geyser plummets to the ground within 5 feet of the base of the well.

- If a character tries to take one or more of the trinkets, the will-o'-wisps turn visible, (Looks like just a floating light) accuse the character of being a dishonorable thief, and insist that the stolen items be returned to the well at once
- They attack if the character fails to return the stolen trinkets or provide worthy substitutes.

# Brigand's Tollway

> As you guys travel towards Downfall, a foggy marsh stretches out before you. The swamp is more heavily populated with tall, thick trees, providing a heavy shade. Rickety causeways made of wooden planks form a wide, web-like structure above the bog. Three hundred feet away, many of these causeways converge on an enormous, ivy-covered tree stump that rises a good ten feet above the fog bank that enshrouds it.

### Traveling on the Causeways:
- The wooden causeways are 5 feet wide and in poor shape. 
- Characters who walk across the planks are assumed to be taking care to avoid unsafe areas. 
- If a character runs across the planks, roll a d8 at the end of the character's turn. On a 7 or 8, part of the causeway falls away beneath the character, who must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling off the plank and into the bog. 
- While prone in the muck, the character is restrained. A character can use an action to try to free itself or another creature from the muck, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.
- Agdon and his fellow harengons know the causeways well enough to avoid sections that are too weak to support their weight.

## Agdon and the Brigands
- As the characters make their way along one of the causeways, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:

> An odd feeling suddenly comes over you as you become aware that somewhere along the way, a hunched, hooded figure has joined the group.

- When he is noticed, he casts off his cloak with a flourish, revealing his 15-foot-long, bright blue scarf. He holds a hot branding iron in one hand and a small round shield in the other.
- He tries to use quickfingers on the player who notices him (or whoever makes sense)
- Agdon sings the song as he takes off at a run, a wide grin on his rabbit face as he bounds from one plank to another in a circle around the party. 

- You notice, arriving out of the mist from the direction of the tree stump, 2 skiffs, each manned by 4 brigands. A Perception check of DC 15 would notice 3 regular brigands and a sniper. Each skiff has two rowers, a lookout (the sniper), and a bagpiper.
-The brigands spring onto nearby causeways, advance to melee range, and try to knock out characters and rob them without killing anyone, while the snipers stay in the skiffs. Any character rendered unconscious by the brigands is stable at 0 hit points.

## Agdon insults
- Do you need me to stand still so you can hit? I’m not sure it’d help.
- Is this your first day using a sword?
- Maybe if I blindfolded myself with my scarf this’d be a fair fight.
- Oh, you know magic, do you? You should summon some... skill.
- I’ve fought Boggles more dangerous than you.
- Too stubborn to hand over your loot, but too incompetent to win.
- You made an underwhelming first impression, and it’s not improving.

### Quick Fingers:
- Sleight of Hand check (+7) with a DC of the player's passive perception + 1.
- On success, Agdon steals an object weighing 1 pound or less that the targets has in its posession but not in it's grasp without them noticing.

## Development:

- Either the characters defeat Agdon Longscarf, or he and his brigands subdue and capture them.

### Agdon is defeated:
-  If Agdon is killed, his followers wander away, crestfallen. If Agdon lives, his former followers shun him. They regard the characters as formidable, and they enthusiastically offer to show them the way to Downfall, providing a skiff for their use if they so desire.
- If they are asked about Bavlorna Blightstraw or Downfall, the harengons share the following information:
1. Agdon made a pact with Slack-jawed Lorna by which he is obligated to give her one item he steals from each victim.
1. Though Agdon would never admit such a thing, the harengons suspect that their leader is terrified of Slack-jawed Lorna, who moves about on a crawling lily pad.
1. Downfall is home to the Soggy Court, a society of bullywugs that clings to strange, noble customs and rules of etiquette.

### The Characters are Captured:
-  If the characters are knocked unconscious, they are taken to Downfall and placed in the cages that hang outside Bavlorna's cottage (area B14).
