# Summary

- Entered motherhorn and discovered this a huge open ampitheater on the side of a mountain with the dark sky above it, lightning striking huge metal poles jetting out of the castle. 
- You had walked in on a rehearsal with endelyn moongrave in attendance. 
- Stagefright, a formally dressed goblin who carried a gold sceptre, which you guys stole from him thanks to a suggestion spell from Rhend.
- He suggested that you guys were expected and to gain favor in Endelyn's eyes it is wise to perform for her.
- You guys performed a rivetting tale of a father son incestual relationship, a dark tale of forbidden love that ended in death. You guys received a roaring applause
- Endelyn was impressed and was insistent on meeting her in her audience chamber, a more intimate theater, for further discussion.
- She was willing to give up Mikey's lost sense of direction for the unicorn horn but you guys had other plans.
- She gave you a tough fight but she was defeated.
- Exploring more of her castle you guys discovered her prison where you met Glister in an extremely cushy prison cell, drinking wine and eating dates. She is an elf with half her face hidden by a sun mask.
- You guys chose to believe that Endelyn may not really be dead and that she is only defeated in the presence of an eclipse.
- Glister led you to believe a symbolic eclipse may be enough, and using her and a prop for the moon could defeat her for good.
- You guys ventured to the upper floor of the castle where you found a cage of paper birds. The one you guys found most interested was a letter written from Endelyn to someone named Lord Kelek.

>I have written a new play titled The Agonies of Alagarthas. It's a tragic tale inspired by real-life misfortune that I think you might enjoy. You and the other members of the League of Malevolence are invited to Motherhorn to watch a live performance. Your missing colleague, Skylla, has been my guest for some time, but I'm afraid she has worn out her welcome. In exchange for my generosity, I'm hoping you can take her off my hands.

- Rael also noticed a misplaced floorboard in the ceiling that led to a bell tower. That bell had engraved in it, "Toll the bell within this spire, To journey to your heart's desire."
- You guys later went to Endelyn's bedroom where you found Mikey's lost thing (orb of direction). Along with his thing you found some expensive bottles of wine and a presumably magic ring on a shriveled hand which you guys took.
- Someone made too much noise when exiting Endelyn's room and the marionnettes which dangled from the ceiling of her room started screeching, and as you guys exited, Bavlorna Blightsraw was waiting for you on the other side of the orrery's balcony.

# Bavlorna

> You find yourselves at on the second floor balcony of a cylindrical chamber. The balcony moves around the full perimeter of the chamber. An eighty foot copper pole extends from the 1st floor through the top of the ceiling. Looking down into the 1st floor you can see rotating spheres and sickles attached to long metal arms that sweep back and forth as lighting shoots out from the center pole through them. Smokey runes exhale out of the rotating arms when this happens. 

> Across the balcony on the other side, you see a large, rotund silhouette that you recognize as Bavlorna Blightstraw. When the lighting from the copper rod courses through the pole and lights the room you can see that she is postured for violence, like a dog with the hair standing up on it's back. Her hair is dishelved and wearing a scowl. She outstretches her hands from her unwashed cloak and says,

> "You have meddled for the last time. Give me the horn or prepare to be obliterated." 

### Mid combat lines
- "your carcasses will be the newest additions in my parlour."
- "Watch out, your face might get stuck like that."
- (Before a swallow) "Let's see if you taste as good as you look."
- (Before a withering Ray) "Let's wipe that smile off your face shall we?"

### DM notes
- Two Quicklings are behind bavlorna in the hall and are not currently visible behind bavlorna. They roll initiative at the same time as everyone else.
- A creature that touches any part of the lightning rod, enters the contraption's space for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn in the contraption's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in metal armor makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

# Skylla

- Refer to M11. 
- If found, utters words that makes props come alive.

# Cranes

Take 20 minutes and drop them off at the palace of hearts desire.

# The Palace of Hearts Desire.

> You emerge from the mist that separates the domains of Prismerr and emerging from the cloud in dreamlike fashion is a twilit palace. Great marble towers ringed by delicate spires spring from it's base, casting large shadows over the rooftops beneath them. Another tower on the right side facing the palace is torn from it's foundation and held aloft by a coiled beanstalk. Monstrous vines cling to the palace walls and choke the promontory of rock on which it perches. As you look beneath you you can clearly see the divisions in the cloud that divide prismeer, and you can see in it's entirety, the domain. 

As the characters observe their surroundings just a bit:

> Hundreds of birds burst from the canopy of the ancient forest below you and scatter in all directions. Moments later, a much more fearsome creature erupts from the woods: a sinewy, pale-green dragon that takes to the sky and flies toward the palace. Its mighty wings carry it to great heights. Once above the palace, it drops like a stone and vanishes from sight behind the palace's high walls.

(Jabberwock is fed and tired and is in the ballroom which is area P22, entering through a hole in the wall of a bathing room area P25.)

## Palace Features
- The walls, ceilings, and floors inside the palace are made of dressed marble unless the text states otherwise
-  The ceilings throughout the palace are 30 feet high and arched. Climbing gear or magic is needed to scale the palace walls, inside or out.
- Magical wards on all the windows and many of the doors render them immune to all damage and their locks impossible to pick, although a knock spell or similar magic opens a locked window or door. Assume a door is unlocked and a window is locked unless the text states otherwise.
- Most of the locked doors in the palace can be unlocked by placing the crown from the maiden's pond (area P8) on the head of either the iron lion in area P9 or the iron hart in area P10

# After Landing

The characters stand before the gate of the palace. They feel fully long-rested.

> Ivy clings to a set of silvery gates embedded in the palace's outer wall. A luxuriant garden can be seen beyond the bars of the gates. The doors of this double gate stand at about 20 feet tall. There is an inscription in Elvish on the gate that reads, "The lion or the hart must wear the crown. But which one should weight it down?".

# The Garden (P2)

> You open the gate revealing a beautiful garden. The scents of roses, cowslips, and hyacinths suffuse this vast garden. Ahead, a ring of standing stones rises from the flower beds. Glittering streams divide the garden and connect with a large pond shaded by willows. The garden is silent save for the sounds of music and voices coming from a colorful pavilion by the front gate.

## Note
- Minor damage to the garden is tolerated, but widespread destruction causes the iron lion in area P9 and the iron hart in area P10 to burst out of their towers and attack those responsible.


## Garden features (general)

`After the characters have been walking around for a while` notice occupants frozen in time,

> Pixies are suspended in midflight or frozen mid-frolic in the stream, the waters of which are perfectly still. Forest gnome gardeners stand rigidly in flower beds, time-frozen water issuing from their tipped wooden watering cans, or atop small ladders, taking shears to topiaries in need of trimming. Bees and pollen hang motionless in the air.

`Fruit Trees` bear gold and silver fruit. They are magical and the magic can be detected. A creature that eats a gold-skinned fruit gains advantage on wisom saving throws for 24 hours, but this benefit ends if the character eats a silver-skinned fruit. A character that eats a silver skinned fruit gains 10 temporary hit points (goes away w/ gold fruit). These fruits spoil 10 minutes after plucking.

## Garden Locations

> From scanning the garden you become aware of a few features of the garden.

1. Pavilion
1. Moss covered stones forming a ring around a small clearing
1. A large marble fountain on the bank of a stream.
1. (Won't notice unless they get closer but a Woodcutter's axe)
1. Bordered by a bronze fence, what looks like a rose garden.
1. A pond.
1. Two large towers that jut from the garden wall's perimeter. (only Envy's tower is accessible from the garden's ground. The spires have no roofs however, so could be entered from above). They do notice that Envy's tower has a bronze plaque at it's entrance.
1. A ramp that leads up to the Palace's main facade.

# Pavilion (P3)

The entrance to the pavilion is open and music is coming from the inside. If opened they see:
> Seven guests—one of them a talking bear—lounge around a picnic table covered with an emerald-green cloth and laden with cakes, teapots, teacups, and cutlery. Two of the guests are motionless and silent, but the others are engaged in spirited conversation. At the back of the pavilion, a string quartet of badger minstrels plays delicate chamber music.

They are currently having a conversation about whether clotted cream should be applied to a scone before or after jam.

`If questioned`, the guests reveal that they arrived at the palace separately and each of them is waiting to speak to one or more of Zybilna's representatives. They've been here a long time (how long they aren't sure exactly), yet they remain patient and well fed. The guests have wandered the garden but can offer no information about the palace. They know better than to enter the palace without an invitation.

**Treasure** Characters who freed Sir Talavar in chapter 2 find a wrapped present on the table, with their names written on the tag. None of the guests has been rude enough to open it. Inside, the characters find a chime of opening, along with a note that reads in Draconic, "Many thanks! May fortune smile on you. Yours, Sir Talavar."
