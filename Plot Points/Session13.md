# Summary

- Entered motherhorn and discovered this a huge open ampitheater on the side of a mountain with the dark sky above it, lightning striking huge metal poles jetting out of the castle. 
- You had walked in on a rehearsal with endelyn moongrave in attendance. 
- Stagefright, a formally dressed goblin who carried a gold sceptre, which you guys stole from him thanks to a suggestion spell from Rhend.
- He suggested that you guys were expected and to gain favor in Endelyn's eyes it is wise to perform for her.
- You guys performed a rivetting tale of a father son incestual relationship, a dark tale of forbidden love that ended in death. You guys received a roaring applause
- Endelyn was impressed and was insistent on meeting her in her audience chamber, a more intimate theater, for further discussion.
- She was willing to give up Mikey's lost sense of direction for the unicorn horn but you guys had other plans.
- She gave you a tough fight but she was defeated.
- Exploring more of her castle you guys discovered her prison where you met Glister in an extremely cushy prison cell, drinking wine and eating dates. She is an elf with half her face hidden by a sun mask.
- You guys chose to believe that Endelyn may not really be dead and that she is only defeated in the presence of an eclipse.
- Glister led you to believe a symbolic eclipse may be enough, and using her and a prop for the moon could defeat her for good.
- You guys ventured to the upper floor of the castle where you found a cage of paper birds. The one you guys found most interested was a letter written from Endelyn to someone named Lord Kelek.

>I have written a new play titled The Agonies of Alagarthas. It's a tragic tale inspired by real-life misfortune that I think you might enjoy. You and the other members of the League of Malevolence are invited to Motherhorn to watch a live performance. Your missing colleague, Skylla, has been my guest for some time, but I'm afraid she has worn out her welcome. In exchange for my generosity, I'm hoping you can take her off my hands.

- Rael also noticed a misplaced floorboard in the ceiling that led to a bell tower. That bell had engraved in it, "Toll the bell within this spire, To journey to your heart's desire."
- You guys later went to Endelyn's bedroom where you found Mikey's lost thing (orb of direction). Along with his thing you found some expensive bottles of wine and a presumably magic ring on a shriveled hand which you guys took.
- Someone made too much noise when exiting Endelyn's room and the marionnettes which dangled from the ceiling of her room started screeching, and as you guys exited, Bavlorna Blightsraw was waiting for you on the other side of the orrery's balcony.
