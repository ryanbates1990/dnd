# Abandoned Tower in C5

- Crawling with ivy, missing walls in places, moldy, mossy stone.
- The tower is about 4 stories tall, totally abandoned. Each floor is accessable by a single spiral staircase. Players see chamber rooms, a library (mostly empty), mostly empty rooms, what looks like used to be a kitchen, etc. The place is full of large, vile jungle bugs.
    - A 20 to investigation reveals a spell scroll for wall of force
    - A 17 reveals a small key
    - A 15 reveals a journal of notes that contain the following information
        - Notes about a fantastical tree somewhere in the Jungle. He notes that the tree imparted upon him a deeper understanding which he credits his magical discoveries to.

- There is a basement door made of iron bars with 8 door knobs which the players recognize immediately as being a trap. 
- A DC 20 perception you can notice through the iron doors a small protruding rock on the wall that looks like a door stop, but is recognized as a trap.
- A dispel magic spell removes the enchantment. Contact with a wrong doorknob results in 1d4 lightning damage per turn. When they are shocked their hand wraps around the knob and cannot be freed unless by force of another creature or object because you are paralleized. The knobs are arranged in a 2 x 4 grid. The correct knob is:
- X X 0 X 
- X X X X

- If they open the door without noticing the protruding rock, a clinking sound is heard and a gelatenous cube is released from the ceiling and resides in the basement. The cube has visible skeletons from within
- When the basement is clear, there is a small chest on a desk with papers around.
- The chest too is trapped. 
    - A Perception check of 18 will notice a small clump of white hairs underneath the chest
    - A Perception check of 15 will notice a small key hole in the side of the chest.
    - Dispel Magic can be used or the small key.
    - If ignored and opened a spray of necrotic energy is unleashed and the opener takes 4d8 necrotic damage and suddenly appears to have aged slightly.
- When the chest is successfully opened, you find a `Cube of Force`

# Swamp

- Players recognize that the terrain is difficult to traverse in the swamp, lots mosquitos and what not, but you guys manage to find a trail that seems to keep you guys moving at an appropriate pace. And it appears to clear up a bit.

- Characters moving at their normal movement speed notice quicksand with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check or with a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14 or higher. Those traveling faster than their normal movement speed barrel right into the quicksand and sink 1d4 + 1 feet. At the beginning of each turn after sinking into quicksand, the creature sinks another 1d4 feet. Provided the creature is not completely submerged, they can escape from the quicksand on a successful Strength check. The Strength check has a base DC of 10, then increases by 1 for each foot the creature has sunk. If the creature has sunk 5 feet, the DC of the Strength check would be 15. If another creature is assisting the creature out of the quicksand, the base DC for the Strength check is 5 and increases in the same manner mentioned previously â€” for each foot sunk, the DC increases by 1.

-A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.
For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

- Looking around you notice several spots where these sinkholes may occur. Out of one, a Shambling Mound surfaces and attacks the party.
- If killed, a skeleton is found within it's carcass bearing a leather sack with 16 gold and a Dagger of Venom

- The Dagger of Venom:
You gain a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this Magic Weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an Attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become Poisoned for 1 minute. The Dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

# Kenny's Bunker

- Players are attacked by 2 Phase Spiders and 2 Regular Spiders
- If they revist the Bunker, a Perception DC of 10 says The body's are gone and the place looks like it's been further searched through and investigated.

# Janick

- Players can track a set of human tracks.
    - DC 15 Nature Check reveals that it looks like theres probably 4 individuals
- Janick is a spell caster with a ranger friend and 2 strong men. They arrived on a boat. If seen, they are transporting an unconscious Torvosaurus.

- Trap ideas: obvious spike trap (like that in runescape)
- A pair of american's that beat them to the ziggurat- detected by the smell of cigarette smoke and dim torch light
- chasm with spikes.
- Murral with heiroglyphics that basically show the jungle people getting wiped out by disease given to them from a foreigner and them giving sacrifices of gold and flesh to a goddess.
- A set of 6 cobra shaped levers that when pulled on their own don't do anything and when released, release a noxious gas that causes damage in a 5 foot square for the next minute or so and it needs time to fade. when the levers are all pulled at the same time the ornate door is opened and a mummy warrior is released.
- a final set of stairs lead to a small tomb where a king lay and there lies loot of 
1. Potion of invulnerability. 
1. A Bead of Force.
1. A +1 weapon

- Heiroglyphics show the king ruling slaves on how to build this tomb as well as him defeating dinosaurs in the jungle.

- Entrance is atop the pyramid. The pyramid itself is overgrown, mossy, and covered in vines and small monkeys and other jungle creatures. 
- First room contains a small altar like slab that is brown from sacrices being offered.
