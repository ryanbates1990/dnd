# Where We Left Off

- You guys defeated a foul being in the tomb of the ziggarut that you guys are currently standing outside of. The being appeared to come out of a womb like sack growing from the end of a vines, similar to pumpkins.
- Call for nature or investigation check, DC 10, to detect that the beast was strangely both demon and plant.
- You guys opened the tomb and received a potion, a glaive, and a small bead (pass out notecards if they want the stats)
- You guys ran into a group of 3 elves outside the ziggarut that were all rugged and pale in appearance that claimed to be trying to protect sentinels and on the lookout for the jungle people's hunting parties. 
- They told you that they come from a secret city to the east called Prifdinnas.
- They told you that a character named Salizen took the amulet of the planes from them. He fled and was found ruling over the jungle people, rumored to be making promises that by following him they would be granted long life. He was gifted in the arcane and an immortal being but was no deity. A disease of unknown origin quickly consumed his followers and out of embarassment in his inability to heal (for his magic was used to deceive and destroy rather than to protect) he fled and left them to die. His whereabouts of both him and the amulet are unknown, though it is not believed that he's left the plane, for that magic has not been detected.The jungle people are believed to be survivers of Salizen's reign over them.
- The elves were also carrying a dead sentinel that Ivan recognized as his friend Zeno.
- You guys decided that the best course of action was to find and protect the nearest sentinel who is said to be close by east of your guys' current location.

(If asked more questions about the above refer to lore.md)

## Zeno

**Appearance**: older human man with wild hair. His earthen brown shirt tattered an torn, his lifeless body covered in geometric tattoos  
**Personality**: Was a pleasant, wise man who had more vigor in his youth. Would always play too hard.  
**Background/History**: Ran away from home to die. He was running from a sadness he could not cope with. He encountered another sentinel of the forest at his personal grotto where he was given water and food and his wounds cleaned. He prayed and was blessed by Mielikki a responsibility to protect the forest and alert others of danger and was given domain of a specific area.  
**Secrets**: He killed his family out of a fit of rage.

# The Elves

Collectively the know about the jungle people. They normally stick to themselves in a city to the south (a few days journey) across a river. They believe the jungle people are disturbed, tribal, and stupid but surprisingly are gifted beyond their intellect in magical abilities. They've only recently started to cause problems. They are hunting the sentinels and their prayers are not being answered and their shrines are desecrated. 

Part of a clan called the followers of Ehrendil, the king of Prifdinnas.

## Laeroth 
**Appearance**: adorned in gray and dark green clothing with leather wrappings and have long sleneder knives and a long bow and quiver. They have exceptionally pale skin. Each of them have silver jewelry, Laeroth has a necklace with several orange spherical beads hanging off of it (wand of fireballs, family heirloom). Each look rugged and like they've been stressed. Their clothes are stained with sweat and exhibit bags under their eyes and their long brown hair is unkempt.  
**Personality**: Both a broken man and a born leader. Stern but complex. Not really one for humor, but has the ability to embathize. Comes of as brooding and brutish. Straight to the point.  
**Background/History**: Son of a high ranking official, but in childhood was blamed for the death of another young elf, a girl named Yenwe. He was banished and during his banishment absolved from his crime. By happenstance he ran into members of the clan and was reinstated, but was not without his trauma. He eventually found honor in leading groups of rangers on adhoc missions. He is thankful to be absolved but would be lying if he was totally free of bitterness. He knows the Jungle like the back of his hand. He knows the jungle people to be tribally and unwelcoming to outsiders, fanatically religious, and knows their existence was absolved some time ago... maybe 200 years. 
**Secrets**: He has a secret lair that he keeps treasures found during his banished youth. He sometimes visits this jungle cave to seek peace.

## Vulmar
**Appearance**: Pretty similar to Laeroth but is fairer and less broad, though slightly taller.  
**Personality**: Seems like a regular guy at the office doing his job. Not too excitable, but pleasant.  
**Background/History**: Has been a long time friend of Laeroth and was integral in welcoming him back to society. Splits time between hunting game and doing odd jobs with Laeroth.   
**Secrets**: Has accepted his fate that his love for freedom will always eclipse his desire to love romantically, but is occasionally torn from within about it.

## Luvon
**Appearance**: Pretty similar to Laeroth but is smaller and more average looking.  
**Personality**: More excitable and sees joy in the outlandish and absurd, but not without elvish pride and sternness when necessary.  
**Background/History**: Lived a classically good life in Prifdinnas, until the love of his life left him for another elf. He was destroyed. He took it as a fault of himself. He joined Laeroth as an opportunity to expolore and find himself like he has to prove himself masculine.  
**Secrets**: Deeply sad and hides behind a joyous persona.

## Session Begin

- Laeroth confronts the players and says, "If you are not accompanying us we must ride back to Prifdinnas, we will track any hunting parties on the way." and the 3 elves sit upon their large birds and ride off.

**Whenever they go back into the jungle, reintroduce it to them.**
- If they walk down along the river down the plataueu give the description for walking through the city:
> You guys walk through the ruined city and observe a snapshot of a past life that has only been disturbed by erosion and overgrowth. Ruined walls and tables, the occasional impressive display of masonry. As you guys descend into the cover of the jungle the stream has widened to a sizeable stream and continues south into cover of the jungle. The ground around it is soft and as you peer into the dimness of the jungle you see the ever familiar glow of the sirenic mushrooms illuminating with a faint blue light. 

> As you stand on softer ground you look for tracks that would lead you into the right direction

- The players will likely need to spend a long rest. This is where Van enters.
- Can make them nature check for interesting plants as they go through the jungle. 

- During the camp a Perception check of 14 and you notice a foul smell, a faint smell of rotting flesh. If they follow the smell they find a come a tiger that has been killed that looks necrotic and unwell and the blood I black and oozing.

> As you travel you guys notice fingers of creeping decay, patches of the compost like areas you saw earlier in the jungle. Rather than large open areas like before you guys come across areas that are more similar to streams, like tributaries of rot. When you come across them it creates a small canopy in the jungle where the sun shines in and is oddly refreshing.

## Approaching the Grotto

> DC 15 is definite human tracks and they can definitely find the grotto. If they don't make it, as they walk, a perception check of 15 reveals a small stream being sprung from a rock and leading them to the grotto.

Rough patch near the grotto with small wooden barricades that look slightly battered. 

> Have nearest player make a perception check. DC 20 and the notice a trip wire 
- A failed save results in tripping the wire and a firework that massively illuminates the area and the jungle is well lit.
- A vicious velociraptor comes charging out and frothing at the mouth but can't quite reach them.

- If they make the save they can safely approach but the veliciraptor can reach them and makes a charge attack against them. The chain on the raptor is visible.
- The raptor has 60 hp.
- it's really a Labrador like creature and is on a long chain. The druid comes out and the rogue comes out of hiding wearing a gully suit.

## Jinzbom (goes by J)
Same stats/spell as Ivan  
**Appearance**:  
**Personality**:  
**Background/History**:  
**Secrets**:  

## Reuben Vaugn
Rogue of level 5ish  
**Appearance**:  
**Personality**:  
**Background/History**:  
**Secrets**:  

## In the Grotto

> You see 

- A map showing an alternate entrance at the side of the hill to Modropo.
- Jinzbom claims he found an entrance halfway up the plateau of Modropo that he thinks will get them into the city but they can't climb up with the equipment they need to infiltrate.


Inventions:  
- Emergency Quiver: Opening the quiver launches all the arrows forth at once. Make sure you donâ€™t get it confused with your real quiver.
- Det Cord: Gunpowder infused string. Nothing could possibly go wrong!
- Escape Balloon: In case of emergency, pull the string and a balloon will inflate to fly you away from the danger. Getting back down safely might be harder.
- Explosive Hammer: For when you really need to pound down the stone wall. The risks of a hammer chock full of explosives should be obvious.

## The Swamp

###  Quicksand 

> Have them make a nature check as they travel east to look for tracks 
- DC of 10 and they notice tracks of a medium sized creature that go for about 20 feet and disappear.
> Subsequent Survival check DC of 15 tips off that the ground is growing softer and softer and you realize their may be pockets of sinking mud

- Following the tracks results in falling into sinking mud

> When a creature enters quicksand it sounds 1d4+1 feet. On its turn it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged it can escape by using it's action and succeeding a strength check of dc 10+number of feet the creature has sunk.
> A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using it's action and succeeding a strength check of dc 5 + number of feet the target creature has sunk

> Perception check of 20 and someone notices multiple spots of quicksand.
> Perception check of 15 and higher can make a nature check, 15 and higher notice something off about a bush up ahead... 
> 20 on the nature check and that player notices that a particular plan is moving slowly towards them and is alive.

## The Shambling Mound

> Draw a map with quicksand and small sections of bog and begin the encounter
