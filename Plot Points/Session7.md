# Summary
- You guys each found a way to the wayward pool
- Rael lit a beacon at the top of the island in the middle of the pool
- Lamorna the Unicorn appeared on the shore and spoke to you guys telepathically
- She gave you bits of information about Zybilna and her palace, hopefully you wrote it down because I didn't.
- You were attacked by a very small, hooded orc that was blasted away by Juan
- Juan took an invisibility potion from the creature
- You guys met up with Will and the rest of the getaway gang and proceeded with his plan on infiltrating Loomlurch with the addition that Juan is now invisible.
- You guys stopped by the goblin market and traded a couple trinkets for some candy
- You met with Skabatha in her parlour where Harrison decided to perform for Skabatha, who was unconvinced or your true motives of the meeting.
- Mikey decided this was a good time to eat his candy
- The children set off the alarms (the screaming scarecrows in the garden)
- Skabatha, discerning you guys were up to no good, set her 3 mimic recliners upon you, 2 of which were slain. Simultaneously, Juan iniated combat with Skabatha
- Skabatha fled for a few rounds and returned having captured Obi, the early adolescent dwarf.
- Rael was turned into a rat, and the rest of the party fell unconscious in combat.
- Juan turned to escape through the door in which you guys came
