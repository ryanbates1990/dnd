# Juan

> Juan, you see your friends struggling for your lives, you escape, still invisible, from whence you came. You are standing, heavy breathing, outside of Skabatha's lair onlooking the goblin market. It is populated with the same crowd as before, 1 or 2 goblin bystanders, Chucklehead muttering to himself, and those working the stalls. What do you do?

- As he leaves loomlurch, your invisibility fades.

- If he goes back to Little Oak, there is a group of Pixies talking to little oak, if not, there is a dryad being harassed by a group of pixies in italian accents
- They are looking for their friend Marco
> Say you don't look like you're from around here, say, whatta ya up to out here uh?

> We're lookin to bust these kids out ourselves you know, as a show of good faith to the higher ups you know?

> Say, if you want to help us why don't you see our boss? He doesn't like people helpin us without him knowin you know? Besides, you might get paid.

- If Juan agrees,the put a sack on his head and say don't worry, this is standard protocol, and they offer you a drink. If you take it, you shrink down to tiny size and they forcibly put a bad on your head and say, no need to panic, but our boss likes to keep his whereabouts hidden.

### The Pixies
1. Vinnie
1. Paulie
1. Leo

- Really they are looking to establish a casino in Yon and want a friendship from those in power to set up the operation in Yon.
- He needs to establish in Yon because of the energy provided by the storms, and we can set up an operation to siphon it from endelyn.

Godfather motivation: the forest is slowly dying under granny nightshade, who rely on the forests health for its fairy ring network as fey crossings on his own plane, the shadowfell. He can plane shift buy many of his employees cannot.

## Meeting the Fairy Godfather

- put on the correct music
> You walk into a dim office where a fairy with an underbite rests with a cigar in hand and on his desk, a mostly finished plate of spagheti and meatballs. In his lap is a small beetle that he strokes like a house cat. What brings you to my office?

- The Fairy Godfather offers a relationship in which you are given a hexblade warlock pact. To initiate the relationship he wants you to bring Will to him. He is also interested in the children getting out of Loomlurch.

# The Others

> You guys awake in a small Prison, slumped against the walls resting in about 8 inches of water. The only light that enters the room are faint glows that reach through the ill fitted floorboards from above and that of a small trap door in the ceiling. You guys are all in the same cell, you can just make out another where you see another figure populating it, but can't make out any distinct features. You also notice faint footsteps on th wooden floor above you. As you awake you begin to notice you feel lighter. You pat around your bodies and you realize your weapons are missing and you stachel with spell components is gone. You still have most of your usual belongings though. The figure  in the room with you notices you stirring and says, "Ah, I was wondering when you guys would wake up. I see you've met the same fate as I." 

## Getting out of the Prison
- DC 18 Dex with thieves tools
- DC 22 Strength (or combined strength)  

If they fail to get out of prison on their own, have Mishka come down and they can try again. 

## Things Elkhorn knows
- Part of an adventuring party called Valor's call. We came to track down the League of Malevolence, a crew that has been committing heinous crimes on other planes. We believed they were here, and sought to create an alliance with Zybilna to bring them down.
- We came in contact with the League of Malevolence in the palace of hearts desire and we fought in glorious battle. The next thing I remember though is waking up here. 
- Skabatha interviewed me but she seems to have lost interest and forgot about me. Left me here to die. I gave her a piece of my mind when she dropped you guys off though don't get me wrong.
- Every once in a while Mishka would come down and say hi and give me a piece of bread to me going, if I get out of here I want to save each and every one of these children.

## Valor's Call
- Strongheart
- Mercion
- Ringleron
- Elkhorn
- Mollivor

## Where is Skabatha?

- She has taken to her bedroom for an early rest.
