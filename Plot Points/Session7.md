# Juan

> Juan, you see your friends struggling for your lives, you escape, still invisible, from whence you came. You are standing, heavy breathing, outside of Skabatha's lair onlooking the goblin market. It is populated with the same crowd as before, 1 or 2 goblin bystanders, Chucklehead muttering to himself, and those working the stalls. What do you do?

- As he leaves loomlurch, your invisibility fades.

- If he goes back to Little Oak, there is a group of Pixies talking to little oak, if not, there is a dryad being harassed by a group of pixies in italian accents
- They are looking for their friend Marco
> Say you don't look like you're from around here, say, whatta ya up to out here uh?

> We're lookin to bust these kids out ourselves you know, as a show of good faith to the higher ups you know?

> Say, if you want to help us why don't you see our boss? He doesn't like people helpin us without him knowin you know? Besides, you might get paid.

- If Juan agrees,the put a sack on his head and say don't worry, this is standard protocol, and they offer you a drink. If you take it, you shrink down to tiny size and they forcibly put a bad on your head and say, no need to panic, but our boss likes to keep his whereabouts hidden.

### The Pixies
1. Vinnie
1. Paulie
1. Leo

- Really they are looking to establish a casino in Yon and want a friendship from those in power to set up the operation in Yon.
- He needs to establish in Yon because of the energy provided by the storms, and we can set up an operation to siphon it from endelyn.

Godfather motivation: the forest is slowly dying under granny nightshade, who rely on the forests health for its fairy ring network as fey crossings on his own plane, the shadowfell. He can plane shift buy many of his employees cannot.

## Meeting the Fairy Godfather

- put on the correct music
> You walk into a dim office where a fairy with an underbite rests with a cigar in hand and on his desk, a mostly finished plate of spagheti and meatballs. In his lap is a small beetle that he strokes like a house cat. What brings you to my office?

- The Fairy Godfather offers a relationship in which you are given a hexblade warlock pact. To initiate the relationship he wants you to bring Will to him. He is also interested in the children getting out of Loomlurch.

# The Others

> You guys awake in a small Prison, slumped against the walls resting in about 8 inches of water. The only light that enters the room are faint glows that reach through the ill fitted floorboards from above and that of a small trap door in the ceiling. You guys are all in the same cell, you can just make out another where you see another figure populating it, but can't make out any distinct features. In your own cell you see you guys aren't alone in your own cell either, you are accompanied by 2 mostly rotten corpses, they've been here for some time now. You also notice faint footsteps on the wooden floor above you and distinctly smell potatoes. As you awake you begin to notice you feel lighter. You pat around your bodies and you realize your weapons are missing and you stachel with spell components is gone. The figure  in the room with you notices you stirring and says, "Ah, I was wondering when you guys would wake up. I see you've met the same fate as I." 

- Considered to have short rested


## Getting out of the Prison
- DC 18 Dex with thieves tools
- DC 22 Strength (or combined strength)  

If they fail to get out of prison on their own, have Mishka come down and they can try again. 

## Things Elkhorn knows
- Part of an adventuring party called Valor's call. We came to track down the League of Malevolence, a crew that has been committing heinous crimes on other planes. We believed they were here, and sought to create an alliance with Zybilna to bring them down.
- We came in contact with the League of Malevolence in the palace of hearts desire and we fought in glorious battle. The next thing I remember though is waking up here. 
- Skabatha interviewed me but she seems to have lost interest and forgot about me. Left me here to die. I gave her a piece of my mind when she dropped you guys off though don't get me wrong.
- Every once in a while Mishka would come down and say hi and give me a piece of bread to me going, if I get out of here I want to save each and every one of these children.

## Valor's Call
- Strongheart
- Mercion
- Ringleron
- Elkhorn
- Mollivor

## Where is Skabatha?

- She has taken to her bedroom for an early rest.

## What kids are in what rooms?

# The Kitchen (L13)

- Doors to L14 and L15 (study and outside) are locked

> This squalid kitchen is carved out of the trunk of the fallen oak. A large clay oven sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by crowded shelves laden with forest fungi, jars of pickled grubs, animal skulls, and moldy cookbooks. Sickly-sweet vapors emerge from a cauldron that rests atop the oven.

> A young human girl shackled to a worktable is hard at work peeling potatoes. A green dragon the size of a large dog is coiled up near the oven, apparently dozing, Fumes rise from the wyrmling's nostrils.

## Mishka 
Child Worker. Mishka (a 9-year-old female human) serves Granny Nightshade as a scullery maid. Mishka has managed to escape from Loomlurch twice, only to be tracked down by Cradlefall and recaptured both times; that's why Granny Nightshade now chains her to the worktable. 

- As an action, a character using thieves' tools can pick the lock on Mishka's ankle cuff with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Any key that unlocks the kitchen doors also unlocks Mishka's chains.

If Skabatha isn't present, Mishka tells the characters about the hag's daily routine and describes Granny Nightshade's minions (see Where's Skabatha? and " Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter). She suggests that they lure Granny Nightshade into the oven and burn her up.

## Oven
- Large enough to cook medium creatures. 5 foot wide iron door. If someone peers inside, can see the coal-black eyes of a fire elemental (who can't be targeted while it is trapped in the oven)
- Any creature that enters the hot oven or starts its turn inside it takes 10 (2d6 + 3) fire damage. A character can try to shove a Medium or smaller creature into the oven, if the creature is within 5 feet of the oven's open door (see " Shoving a Creature" in the Player's Handbook). If the creature is looking into the oven when it is shoved, the Strength (Athletics) check to shove the creature is made with advantage.

## Cookbooks. 
Granny Nightshade has several cookbooks in her kitchen that contain candy recipes. One of these books has a 1-foot-long piece of gnarled root as a bookmark; this object is the cutting that Granny Nightshade took from the shambling mound in area L5.

## Treasure. 
Searching Granny Nightshade's kitchen reveals the following treasures:
1. Six brass egg cups embossed with the faces of crying children (5 gp each)
1. An ornate eight-minute hourglass (75 gp)
1. A moldy wooden coffer labeled "Mushrooms" (in Elvish) that contains two butterfly saddles and a hummingbrella (see area L5 for descriptions of these mushrooms)
1. In addition, Elkhorn's shield and +1 longsword can be found inside a small cupboard.

# Family Tree (L11)
- Door to L6 (outside) is locked.

> This room has three doors and a wood-carved staircase that ascends to a higher level. The walls are a dense tangle of tree roots and brambles, nestled among which are five animated portraits: one of a svelte, dark-haired woman and the others depicting hags.

- A truly ancient and terrifying hag (Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches)
- A toadish hag (Bavlorna Blightstraw, as depicted in appendix B)
- A skeletal hag wearing a black, theatrical contraption resembling a dress (Endelyn Moongrave, as depicted in appendix B)
- A hag with a wind-up key in her back, one empty eye socket, and a wooden eye held in her hand (Skabatha Nightshade, as depicted in appendix B)
- A svelte, dark-haired woman with a commanding presence (her appearance matching that of the Tasha mannequin outside the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival, as described in chapter 1)

## The Portraits
The portraits are enchanted to display the last creature that pricked its skin on the brambles' thorns in addition to its four closest family members, if it has any. These family members can be living or dead. (If the creature has fewer than four close family members, any remaining portraits are blank.) Each portrait magically animates to create the impression that the subject is looking around and shifting uncomfortably, but the animation has the quality of an old movie. The moving images are silent.

## Pricking Thorns. 
Any creature that reaches toward a portrait must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pricked by the thorny brambles. The prick deals no damage, but the portraits change to match the pricked creature and up to four of its closest family members.

# Textile Mill (L12, upstairs from the Portraits)
> Three large, freestanding looms dominate this chamber. A young goblin and a pair of gnome children work the machines, filling the room with a loud, rhythmic clatter. A door is set in the opposite wall, and an archway to the east leads to a storeroom.

- one of the doors leads to a balcony where 2 tin soldiers patrol area L6.
- there are 3 boggles playing pranks (a hand coming out of the rift to provoke, objects coming out, oil, etc.)

## Children
- Yvelda (8 year old female goblin)
- Callybon (an 11 year old female forest gnome)
- Callybons brother, Pogo (a 9 year old male forest gnome)

They are eager to escape Loomlurch but won't converse with strangers until the area is cleared of boggles.

## What do they know?
- Yvelda knows a scret route into Skabatha's bedroom. Climb outside the storeroom window, clamber across branches that grow out of the upright trees and pass above the kitchen area. From there you can hop onto the windowsill of the hag's bredroom. (Requires DC 13 dexterity check, failed save falls off the room taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage).
- Yvelda, in the hag's private quarters, witnessed Pud (another child in L8) reporting something to the hag.

## Treasure (searching the store room, a closet attached to the mill)
- A pouch holding 35 sp (the coins' mintage is unfamiliar to the characters)
- A small, leather-bound book containing delicate sketches and watercolor paintings of pixies, sprites, and other Fey (50 gp)

# Cupbords (L10, attached to the Portrait Room)
