# Casino
The Casino has dim lighting and it flickers on an off but is overall well furnished and probably floating at about half capacity. Italian Pixies are fluttering about and recognize Rael and Mikey.

If The players press questions about Endelyn they are questioned:
- Why are you concerned about her?
- She is always anxious/paranoid about the future
- and told to go speak to Giovanni, he might have more information.
- If heard questioning about Endelyn, several Italian Pixies (**Vinnie** and **Paulie**) are fluttering about escort them to Giovanni.

If they never ask about Endelyn, Vinnie and Paulie recognize Rael and Mikey and start a conversation.

**Giovonni** The owner is in his office. Can't impart much knowledge on Endelyn herself, but knows she has a secret on how to greater harness the energy from the skies. She has quite an impressive theater that she runs and we want in on that abilty. He offers 4000 gold for her secret.

**A Scrawny, swashbuckling dressed Goblin named Wyatt** every once in a while when the electricity dims, he wins a big prize at a slot machine. If the players investigate and **Insight check DC 17** can tell he is cheating. An **Investigation check DC 15** Reveals that when the lights dim he pulls the lever twice in quick succession and wins a jackpot. If brought to Giovanni, they are thanked mightily and can ask a favor (can be denied) otherwise they are given 200 gold, as long as they spend some time gambling it.

**Elves doing drugs**
- Elves doing lines of some burnt orange powerder substance in the back (**Intelligence check of 10 you can conclude this must be some powerful stuff**).
- multitude of races (elves, goblins, dejected looking fairies), all doing this substance they call `Rust`. If taken it provides **+2 Charisma, and +2 strength, -4 intelligence**. If done 3 times, the person becomes dependent and faces a level of exhaustion if haven't reupped in 2 hours, 2 levels of exhaustion for a day without it. 2 days without it they are healed from their physical draw but if they see it, they feel compelled to get it again and is readdicted after 3 subsequent uses. 
- A cyclops named **Rodney, nicknamed Big Rod** that keeps eyeballing Rex from across the room.

**Through the Back Door**  
Loading Dock, you can see Crates and Crates being loaded onto a dock. Most of them are casino needs (slot machines, drinks, kegs, chips, etc.). An **investigation check of DC 12** reveals a mass amount of children's toys.

These Childrens toys are being filled with drugs made from modified pixie dust. The toys are traded from skabatha. The drugs are taken to the material world and sold. The operation is being run by the Fairy Godfather.

**They can make a deal to** take a crate of drugs to an elf named Sliske who operates as an apothecary near Motherhorn). Sliske will pay handsomly. If players accept they are offered 300 gold pieces. If they don't deliver the goods they will be hunted.

- In the Den is glowing, cyan blue, bioluminescnnt mosses and algeas coating this dank den.
- There is a canopy with a carved path where a giant telescope is attached.
- There is a desk with no notes, some carvings on the walls that look like lunar tracking and constellations and they are dated, last one about 3 years ago.
- Pool about 8 feet deep with light glowin runes at the bottom that reads, "I am Mazikoth, keeper of the stars." and below it in smaller runes looks like the carving similar to a spell scroll for astral projection.
- if activated that player is launched from their body into the astral plane by a silver tether. While in the astral plane they are faced with dilemmas of their own consciousness, they are keenly aware of their own condition. Things about their inner working become easy to label as good or bad, faulty logic or circular justifications become aware to you. It is an eye opening experience and you feel wiser because of it. Permanently add 2 to your wisdom modifier. When they return they are weakened and suffer a level of exhaustion.
