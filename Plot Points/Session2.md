# Disarray in Diigundo

Remember to:
- make a letter from Peabody's mining company
- Draw map of Diigundo

### The Bunker

- Outside the bunker, if they go deeper into the jungle, is a graveyard of failed innovations. Some look in worse shape than others.
- They see where a massive web was disrupted. Along with some not so disrupted webs. 
- Hanging around too long invokes an encounter

- The bunker contains the following items
1. A big sign that says, "The Danger Zone"
1. A loin cloth that has a rather ornate design but notably has a logo that is a triangle with 3 drops on it.
1. A set of large golden earrings
1. A handful of Golden bracelets
1. 36 gold pieces
1. A drawer full of work notes and drafts of ideas and failed ideas for innovation.
1. A map of Diigundo village (that is mostly highlighting pine farms and growth stages)
1. A small picture frame with a picture of Kenny's mother


- A Religion check on the loin cloth would require a DC of 14 to recognize that it comes from Talona. DC of 18 you get that Talona is known as the Lady of Poison, Mistress of Disease, and Mother of All Plagues.

- A perception check of 20 will notice a set of eyes from deeper within the jungle watching them. (This is a tribal encounter if they choose to engage)

### Thorny Bumpkin (Inn)

### Leaving the Jungle

- June is at the edge of the jungle (but still within) and attempts to hide. Roll her stealth with advantage and see if she is noticed.
- Passive perception of 13 is the highest I believe.. maybe 15.
- If she _is_ noticed have her declare immediately, "I'm not with the Lumber Company and I know neither are you!"
- June is looking for the Red Amunita mushroom.
- During the day she thought she found some ideal conditions she wants to explore again.
- She asks for assistance, she is scared
- Says Herb at the Pestle and Mortar can make them into healing potions for a small fee. 

### The Lumber Warehouse

- Players can smell the fire and can see clouds of dark smoke looming in the distance, the wind has carried it off but not dispersed it
- The corner that the office is in is severely burned 
- Guards are gathered in a group huddling and talking similar to a group of referees discussing an offsides or false start penalty.
- A crowd of a like 20 people has gathered and is chatting amongst themselves, slowly dispersing because most of the action has died
- A loud voice or 2 shouting hysterics like what monster did this? Is there a competitor trying to ruin us? How will I feed my family?


### Sleep

During this first night, anyone (at least Malthos) who was charmed by the mushrooms has a vision. The vision is as follows:

- (Ask others to leave the room). 
- Change music to Derek Fiechter's "Space Station" Song
- You find yourself conscious in a dark void. You are comfortable and all is quiet. Suddenly you become aware of the fingertips on your left hand. It's the only part of your body you can feel and you notice that the tips of those fingers produce a faint blue glow. Slowly the glow extends from your fingertips into your hand. You then notice a thin strand of blue flowing like water underneath your skin upwards towards your elbows and your elbow begins to glow. The thin strand progresses towards your shoulders and a large node of blue begins to glow. Enough light is produced from your glowing body now that you can see a the base of a feverwood tree in front of you just a few feet away. The strands continue further and further until your entire body looks like a constellation of big blue stars connected by tiny blue strands. But then. A shooting pain errupts from your belly. It cools to a dull ache but you notice that the large node centered in your abdomen now glows red. You look up, and see that the feverwood tree begins to wither. Your dream ends.


### Meeting Back up with Rodney and Mitch

- They're suspicious that they had something to do with the fire..
- They don't know about Kenny yet and want to pay you guys off and don't want to be seen with you guys.
- They feel as though they've made a mistake and want to leave immediately. 

### The poisoned well

- Priscilla is suspicious
- June and Marty are at a table reading and drinking coffee.
- They saw them leaving the Jungle last night and want to initiate a hushed conversation. 
- They want your guys' protection 
- Can't get the lumber company because they are putting up too much red tape.

### The Red Amunita Mushrooms

- June asked Marty to meet them at the edge of the jungle to protect them while they look for the Red Amunia Mushrooms
- If they focus on any patches of blue mushrooms the need to make a wisdom save to protect them from being charmed by the blue mushrooms (DC 13)
- When they find the Red Amunita Mushrooms they see a Jungler harvesting the mushrooms and attempts to hide
- There is an ecounter with 3 non magic junglers and magic Jungler.
- One will try to escape at the end of the encounter. 

### Encounter

- Roll stealth for junglers, must beat passive perception of 14.. else if they ask for perception, a contest.
- 3 Junglers attack, Mage casts Entangle on as many as he can get.
- June hides, The Junglers try and take her.

### Tracking the Junglers

- The come across a symbol that is recognized as with a 15 in religion Talona, Goddess of Disease and Poison
- A history check would know that people have seen these people before but they got sick and died from exposure to more civilized folk.
