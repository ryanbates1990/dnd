# Rules of Conduct

### Rule of Hospitality. 
When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.

### Rule of Ownership. 
You must not steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn't belong to you without the rightful owner's permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.

### Rule of Reciprocity.
When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.

# Summary
- You guys found yourselves at the witchlight carnival remembering things you guys lost here as children.
- You guys thought it best to check the lost items section where you found a displacer beast with colorful fake wings tending to lost children, whom you guys helped bring a child back to the lost items center.
- Mikey lost a cupcake eating contest but deceptively passed his own vomit for Leeroy, and claimed a prize of a cupcake that when eaten turns you invisible.
- With the nod from Burly the Bugbear, you guys used that in conjunction with setting a dressing room trailer on fire to steal one of the owner's, Mr. Witch's pocketwatch.
- Desperate to get the pocketwatch back and deeming you worthy, gave you a spell that would activate a portal in the hall of illusions, a carnival attraction.
- In the hall of illusions you saw a halfling that had just failed a marriage proposal step into a mirror following a small, blue girl wearing a pig mask.
- Reaching the end of the attraction you guys found an ornate mirror and cited the spell and a portal appared. You guys stepped through.

# Arrival in Hither
> You stand at the edge of a raised and broken causeway under a hazy, twilit sky. The causeway, which is built from pale stones that glow faintly from within, towers over the surrounding landscape, but large sections of it have crumbled away. The parts that remain in place are separated by large gaps where portions have collapsed.
> A fog-shrouded swamp spreads out below you in all directions, and up from its murk wafts the smell of rotting plants. Also rising from the swamp is the music of nature—a discordant symphony of croaking frogs and singing birds.

- Any character who's lost thing is Bavlorna senses his thing is close
- introduce alex

- The highway is 20 feet wide and 100 feet above the swamp
- Large, colorful shelf mushrooms cling to the lower half of each support pillar. 
- The marshland surrounding the pillars is hidden under a 10-foot-thick blanket of fog that heavily obscures all creatures inside it.
-  Any character who tries to climb a pillar without using handholds, footholds, climbing gear, or magic must succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check or fall, taking damage as normal.

# Balloon Crash 

- Before the characters descend from their perch on the Queen's Way, the one with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something.

> In the distant sky, you spot a great balloon made of patchwork material. It spins out of control as though punctured, causing the wicker basket that hangs from it to swing wildly. The balloon plunges out of sight, disappearing into the fog approximately a mile away.

# Reaching the Bottom

- Water beneath the queen's way is low
- giant crane (use the pteranodon stat block) previously hidden by the fog emerges and takes flight. The giant crane poses no threat, but its sudden movement alerts a band of brigands lurking nearby.

> Sticky mud squelches beneath your feet. Tangled mangroves grow out of pools of rippling water, half hidden by the thick fog, and purple mushrooms cling to rotting logs and stumps scattered throughout the marsh. Crickets that glow like fireflies chirp serenely before they're snatched out of the air by the tongues of hungry frogs.

> Coming from one direction are several voices joined in a marching song. The singing grows louder as six bipedal rabbits wearing clothing emerge from the fog. Two of them tug at the reins of a giant snail, and the others carry clubs and slings.

Their song:  
With sticks and stones, we'll break your nose;

We'll beat you blind and steal your clothes.

But none among us can compare

To one wily, swift, and stand-up hare—

Scarf that's glorious, thief notorious,

His deeds are truly meritorious!With a wink and a grin, he'll show his cunning;

A flash of his scarf, he'll take off running.

Quick as a bolt, his long scarf trailing,

Gasping, grasping, you'll end up flailing.

You'll pout, you'll moan, you'll huff, you'll sneer;

Thanks to Agdon Longscarf, brigand prince of Prismeer!
'

- Four of the brigands have their weapons drawn, and the other two browbeat their pack animal, a giant snail (see appendix C). The snail is hostile toward its keepers and indifferent toward other creatures. Characters who participated in the Witchlight Carnival's snail race (see chapter 1) have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to win over the giant snail, turning it into a friendly ally.'

# Roleplaying the Brigands

- If the characters don't attack immediately, one of the brigands with weapons drawn signals the others to stop singing with a wave of her hand. 
- She introduces herself as Jebbek, and she says to the characters, "This is a robbery. If you resist, we'll beat you black and blue."

# Jebbek
- No interest in treasure
- She demands that each character surrender the feeling of delight they remember from when they were given the best gift they ever received.
- Jebbek produces a stoppered gourd that can hold these memories
- The stopper sports a golden knob, and any character who voluntarily touches the knob while Jebbek is holding the gourd loses the memory Jebbek wants to steal, as it is siphoned away and trapped in the gourd. (Give each player a minute or so to think about what the character's memory could be and then to note it on their character sheet, as a matter of record.)
-  Removing the stopper releases all memories trapped inside the gourd, whereupon they return to their original owners.

- If all the characters comply, the harengons leave with the gourd full of happy memories, saying that "Agdon Longscarf is much obliged."
- If one or more characters refuse to give up their cherished memories, the brigands threaten the characters with a beating. At this time, the characters can make a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) group check. If the group check succeeds, the brigands are cowed by the characters' resolve and retreat into the swamp rather than risk getting whomped by the party. On a failed check, the harengons try to beat the characters unconscious and steal their weapons, though they flee if the fight turns against them.
- Jebbek's gourd was a gift to Agdon Longscarf from Bavlorna Blightstraw. Although any creature can plug or unplug the gourd's stopper, only Agdon or another creature he designates (in this case, Jebbek) can use the gourd to trap memories.

# After the Brigands

# Slanty Tower
- Characters might travel to Slanty Tower because they headed in that direction after one of them saw the balloon crash shortly after their arrival. Otherwise, they stumble across this location while exploring.

> A crumbling stone tower rises out of the swamp, leaning at such an angle that it threatens to keel over. Black brambles surround the base of the tower and cling to its lower half. Hanging from the crenellations on the lower side of the tower's peak is a large woven basket at the end of a tangle of ropes and tattered fabric. The basket dangles thirty feet above the surface of the swamp.

- 50 feet tall and 20 feet in diameter, open door at the bottom on the side opposite where the basket is hanging
- The interior of the tower is empty except for a flight of stairs that spirals up the inside wall to an opening in the ceiling that leads to the crenellated roof.
- Black brambles cover the ground within 30 feet of the tower, clustering in a dense patch around the open doorway. These brambles are difficult terrain. Each 5-foot-square section has AC 11, 15 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

# Sir Talavar's Plea for Help
- The Characters cannot see sir Talavar right away
- As the characters approach the edge of the bramble patch, they hear a whispered voice say in Common, "Psst. You there, I need your help." The whisper comes from the basket that dangles from the top of the tower. If a character responds with anything louder than a whisper, a quick "Shush!" cuts them off. The voice belongs to Sir Talavar, who quietly explains his predicament:

> "I'm in a bit of a bind, as you can observe. I, Sir Talavar, as one of the Summer Queen's loyal servants, ask that you free me. You see, I was in the midst of a daring escape from the vile Bavlorna Blightstraw when our balloon was set upon by an ill wind and sent plummeting to its current unfortunate location. My pilot, the honorable Wigglewog, did not survive. I've been trapped up here for a while now. Help me. I must tell my queen of the fall of Prismeer!"

- If the characters speak in raised voices, Sir Talavar shushes them again. If asked why it's important to remain quiet, he says:

> "Two serpents are asleep in the brambles, just outside the tower door. If you awaken them, they might put the squeeze on you, or worse, devour me."

- The characters can't see Sir Talavar from the ground, because he is locked in a birdcage inside the basket that dangles from the tower's peak. Characters on the roof of the tower can look down into the basket and see the corpse of Wigglewog, the balloon's bullywug pilot, who died in the crash. At the bottom of the basket, a silver birdcage lies on its side with Sir Talavar inside.

- A detect magic spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the birdcage. While Sir Talavar is in it, he can't cast spells, but he can use his Euphoria Breath. The cage is locked and can't be destroyed, and its lock can't be picked. A knock spell or similar magic opens it, however.

## (Notes) The Calamitous Flight of Sir Talavar and Wigglewog
[–]
Prior to the events of this adventure, Sir Talavar, a noble faerie dragon and emissary of Titania the Summer Queen, traveled to Prismeer to persuade Zybilna to ally with the Seelie Court against its hated enemies, the fomorians. Sir Talavar soon discovered that Prismeer had been seized by the hags of the Hourglass Coven. Before he could return with news of their treachery, Bavlorna trapped him in an enchanted silver birdcage that inhibits his magic.

A sympathetic bullywug named Wigglewog stole Sir Talavar's cage and fled with it in one of Bavlorna's balloons. Soon after, the balloon was attacked by a malicious wind (air elemental) that sent it careening into an ancient, crumbling tower in the middle of Hither's swamp. The bullywug died in the crash, and Sir Talavar (still in his cage) has been stranded since then in the dangling wreckage of the balloon.

A pair of serpents in Bavlorna's service caught up to the balloon, but they are too lazy to climb up the tower to reach it. They have since fallen asleep near the base of the tower.

# Roleplaying Sir Talavar
[–]
Sir Talavar is a knight-errant of the Seelie Court and a loyal vassal of the Summer Queen. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Sir Talavar.

The faerie dragon has an upbeat demeanor and is a strict observer of noble etiquette and courtesies. He knows the way to Downfall and can point characters in the right direction. He can also impart the following useful information:

### What does he know?
- Bavlorna Blightstraw lives in a spooky cottage on stilts at the heart of Downfall, a bullywug settlement. The bullywugs of Downfall are quite courteous and welcoming, provided one does not offend them.
- Bavlorna has the ability to conjure minions that look like tiny versions of herself.
- Bavlorna has two sisters whom she loathes. Together, the three hags form the Hourglass Coven. Using an artifact called Iggwilv's Cauldron, the coven has frozen time in Zybilna's palace, trapping the archfey inside.
- A goblin named Jingle Jangle has the key to Sir Talavar's birdcage. (She saw her leave it in her possession). She lives atop Telemy Hill, not too far from Slanty Tower.
- Sir Talavar explains that he must be set free so that he can return to his queen and report the news that Zybilna has been overthrown by the Hourglass Coven.

If the characters are unable to open the birdcage on their own, Sir Talavar asks them to get the key from Jingle Jangle, offering them his magic sword in return for his release (see "Development" below). Sir Talavar knows she lives on Telemy Hill.
