# Diigundo Village

A recently developed village (As far as northerners goes, no one knows what happened to the original Diigundan village. Rumour is they were executed to eliminate competition) that is booming quickly yet is a bit of an oasis as far as commercial development goes. Logging is the primary reason to come here as it resides on the edge of the Lugakayo Jungle. The forest provides a valuable lumber that is particularly hard and sturdy and is high demand from the northern kingdoms. Locals have also developed a drug problem from hallucinogens found in the jungle.

Not much is known of the Lugakayo Jungle and is often linked to superstition and disease. Because of this, the logging done in the area is highly lucrative and a highly dangerous job. Recent excursions from both Universities and Government Researches are sent in the form of botanists and bodyguards to learn from the jungle to try and uncover what is so dangerous (or, to reveal that there is no actual danger). Botanists typically want to learn from the jungle (medicinal purposes, research the animals and see there positive impact on the volatile ecosystem) and the bodyguards that typically accompany want to thwart their efforts in attempt to prove the area non-threatening and it all a hoax. This creates a tension among the populus

# Factions:

## Cloudspire Academy Students
- Primarily want to learn from the Jungle
- Enthusiastic students from Cloudspire University (The Manticores) to study alchemy and botany in the village.
- Currently have rudementary knowledge of the jungle. Much of what they know isn't an exact science, but sort of plant based magic. They study and experiment with cause and effect and basic patterns. They are able to uncover likely effects of certain ingredients (sort of like skyrim). 
- Most have greater purpose ambition, ie to uncover better methods of healing sickness and disease. Others have more career based aspirations (to trademark their findings and create their own shops selling unique potions and passing on their trade secrets through their family). Others have more ambitious goals in finding what is possible with potions, someone especially eccentric may want to experiment with potions in the same way someone would experiment with wild magic.
- Helping them likely uncovers knowledge of potions and helpful ingredients.

## Stump 'n Pump Lumber Yard Union
- The Stump 'n Pump Lumber Company was founded much farther north and boomed off the felling of coastal palm trees and more inwardly, pine. As the company decimated all in it's path it did realize the error of it's ways and now reaps much of it's success by farming pine and palms, though the farming cycle is quite long and is not quite successful. Investors have made their claim and kept the business afloat.
- The Company found new life with the discovery of the Feverwood Trees however they have difficult managing the Gympie Plants and other unpleasant things from within the jungle. A single Feverwood tree is monetarily worth that of 40 pines but is much more tedious to extract and cannot be done so efficiently and requires special teams and equipment.
- The Union is often disgruntled by lack of pay and safety precautions. Employees are often used as guinea pigs to test new equipment and methods of extraction against the difficulties provided by the jungle.

- Needs Players to Help with a stealth mission. He overheard Kenny Loggins talking about a secret mission that was to be executed at night.
