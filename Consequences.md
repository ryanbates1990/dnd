# Consequence of a Fading Domain in the Feywild
Anything with that was Sylvan or Shadow would be completely fucked.

So ultimately all energy in the cosmos, comes from the positive or negative plain. Think of the Feywild and the Shadowfell as a PC power supply. But instead of turning AC power into the correct DC voltage. They filter energy into a useful effect. Dead short a PC power supply right to the outlet. Pop all the smoke comes out. Same thing if you destroy those planes of existence.

Assuming that the material plane doesn't totally explode or implode. You would be left with gimped worlds since they are all nested in the cosmology the same way.

So magic items and casters that do nature stuff would explode in a burst of energy if you did anything with them. While magic items that do necromantic and shadow things would do weird stuff like drain you to level 0 and kill you. Maybe suck all light and heat out of the room and spawn some undead.

It would be crazy bad because You would have serious balance problem in your ecology as well. So certain creatures would sicken or just die off. You might even see your elf population tank, because IIRC their gods and a lot of the magic that composes them are tied to the Feywild. So it would end them and possibly the orcs as well. Since in most campaign settings they have shared creation myths.

I mean would a Fairie circle just wither and die or would it erupt in eternal flame? Probably depends on the edition of DnD you play.

Would people and things even have a shadow? More likely if they were in a situation were they cast one, they might begin to fade away until only an undead husk remained.

I mean you could have some fun with it. It would be hilarious if all the brownies or house fairies just burst into flames in the middle of the night with no warning. But would they just be on fire? Would they turn into a permanent 12' blow torch coming out of the place they last stood? Maybe they all explode like a backpack nuke in a basement.

What about Vampires. Does Strahd just fade away? Does he turn into a super vampire and become a god? Maybe he implodes into a Sphere of Annihilation? Fuck if I know.

It would be crazy bad and kinda funny though.
