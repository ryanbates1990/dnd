# The Clockwork District

Welcome to the bustling district of innovation and intellect within the city. This district is home to a blend of brick buildings, open garage workshops, and a bustling population of hard working people. They are often seen with white coats, clipboards, coffee, and a smoke. The Clockwork District is the realm of seasoned researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurial minds who push the boundaries of scientific understanding and magical integration. 

Massive reservoirs containing distilled magical energy, harnessed from various sources snake through tubes and conduits thoughout the district, delivering power to laboratories and workshops.

`GM History Note:` The district's name gets its name from a gnomish inventor who developed the first clock that could reliably tell time. The town was shrouded by magical darkness, leaving the sun-dials useless. Legend has it that military leaders knew an attack was planned at a particular time and the inventors clock allowed them to set up an effective counter-attack, saving the town. It has sense been a popular homage to wear a black stopwatch in remembrance of his contribution. His use of mechanical means blended with arcana was innovative in and of itself which attracted apprentices with ambitious minds that over time evolved into the Clockwork District.

# Landmarks

## The Etherium Reservoir

Spanning a considerable area of the district is the Etherium Reservoir, a massive network of reservoirs containing distilled magical energy. Tubes and conduits snake through the district, delivering this potent magical essence to laboratories and workshops. 

## The ClockTower

The Clocktower is a tall and slender tower, reaching several stories high. Its architectural design combines the precision of gnomish craftsmanship with the elegance of magical embellishments. The tower is constructed from a combination of polished stone and metal, with intricate gears and cogs visibly incorporated into its exterior. Near the top of the tower, there is an observation platform with a protective railing. Visitors can access this platform for a panoramic view of the district and the surrounding city.  Glowing lines of magical energy run along the edges of the clock faces in the shape of gnomish runes, creating a quite mesmerizing display, that you imagine serves a dual purpose in design and function.
