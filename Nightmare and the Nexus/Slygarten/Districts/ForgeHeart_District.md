# Forgeheart

Nestled on the outskirts of the city, the Warehouse and Metallurgy District, known as Forgeheart, stands as the beating heart of blue-collar labor and industrial craftsmanship. In this district, the clang of hammers and the roar of furnaces create a symphony of industry, as skilled workers toil to produce the raw materials and goods that fuel the city's growth.

The district is defined by towering smokestacks and industrial chimneys that pierce the sky, casting a perpetual orange haze over the distrcit. The air is thick with the scent of burning coal and the echoes of labor. 

`GM History Note: ` The cities first metalwork shops sprang about when civilization was threated by hordes of undead were spewing forth from deep cracks within the earth as refugees from the Ravenqueen's wrath. This particular location was chosen for the nearby resources. This provided quite the economic boom. Post-war the district continued to outfit military needs but as demand decreased, synergized well with the clockwork district.

Anymore, the district is largely owned by a famous jeweler (who lives in the wealthy part of the city) named Adolphus Rockwell who aims to monopolize each part of the supply chain, who sometimes does so out of nefarious means and it is rumored he is a cruel master to those who work in the mines.

city produces not just steel but precious metals as well.
