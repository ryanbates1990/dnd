# Forgeheart

Nestled on the outskirts of the city, the Warehouse and Metallurgy District, known as Forgeheart, stands as the beating heart of blue-collar labor and industrial craftsmanship. In this district, the clang of hammers and the roar of furnaces create a symphony of industry, as skilled workers toil to produce the raw materials and goods that fuel the city's growth.

The district is defined by towering smokestacks and industrial chimneys that pierce the sky, casting a perpetual orange haze over the distrcit. The air is thick with the scent of burning coal and the echoes of labor.
