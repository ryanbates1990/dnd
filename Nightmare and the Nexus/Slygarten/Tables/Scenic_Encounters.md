# City Wide Scenic Enounters

| Roll | Encounter Description |
|------|------------------------|
| 1    |    **City Watch Inspection** Members of the city watch are conducting inspections or searching for contraband in a specific area. The players may be questioned or asked to assist, and they could uncover illegal activities or corruption.                   |
| 2    |  **Pickpocket** One of the players is bumped into by a very attractive person who emphatically apologizes. The player closest to the person must make a DC 12 perception check to see that something was stolen from the player. Otherwise the player realizes later what they lost. The pickpocketer is accompanied by 3 friends. [Statblock](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Pickpocketer.md)                 |
| 3    |   **A group of halfling** street performers has a small crowd gathered and beckon for you to to join in the spectacle. If someone does, one comes around and offers a cap for them to put money in. If the players don't, people grumble at the players                |
| 4    |    **A thief** snatches a purse from an old lady nearby and charges away from into a nearby ally                  |
| 5    |    **A Festival** is happening and is similar to what we would call a rennaissance festival. People dressed up in outfits from tribal times. Everyone kind of looks like Max's character and praise him for his incredible outfit. People act in a way that should offend Max for the poor likeness.                  |
| 6    |    **A fat man face down into the street** with a pool of vomit around him is clogging a busy street. He's too heavy to move on his own and someone offers to help move him.    |
| 7    |   **A Portal** opens before you and people ooh and ah. It closes just as quickly as it came, besides a small boy who stuck his head in. An arcana check would reveal it to be an opening to the astral plane. If asked, the boy says he couldn't breathe on the other side, and saw some kind of vessel and a bright beam of light                |
