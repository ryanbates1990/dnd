# Temporary Insanity Effects

| **d6** | **Effect** |
|--------|------------|
| 1      | **Deviant Appetites** - Player immediately falls to their knees and starts cramming whatevers to hand into their mouth. Rocks, sticks, garbage, even dead rats make for a tasty snack for this poor soul. Pass a constitution save of DC14 or lose D6 HP. |
| 2      | **Run To The Hills** - Overcome by fear, the player runs away in panic. Roll a D4(1=N, 2=S, 3=E, 4=W) to determine a direction, and the player moves their full movement on that trajectory (even if they run off the bridge!). Effects pass after one turn. |
| 3      | **Morbid Visions** - Spectral Figures manifest before the player, grasping and clawing at them, whispering doubt and sowing sedition. Player must make a DC14 Wisdom save or take D8 psychological damage. |
| 4      | **Regress To Childhood** - Player is overwhelmed by the slime and mentally caves in. They regress to the mental state of a mewling child. Take D8 psychological damage and change your pants, son. |
| 5      | **Pull The Plug** - Make a DC14 Wisdom Saving throw. Failure means the player descends into a catatonic state for one turn and is unable to fight, defend themselves, communicate, or perform any other action. |
| 6      | **Psychotic Episode** - Complete detachment from reality, the player draws a melee weapon and immediately attacks the character closest to them. |
