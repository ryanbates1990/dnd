# University District

The first thing you notice about Slygarten University is that the air is filled with a palpable energy, and the scent of ancient books and magical reagents wafts through the air. Cobblestone streets are well-maintained, and the brick buildings stand tall and proud, adorned with intricate carvings and arcane symbols. Students in flowing robes and scholars carrying stacks of tomes pass by, engaged in animated conversations about magical theories and their scientific applications and philsophical discoveries. The use of levitating bits and bobs on statues and fountains gives makes you wonder if the campus came from the future. You get the sense that only the sharpest and most fortunate minds get the liberty to study here.
