# University District

The first thing you notice about Slygarten University is that the air is filled with a palpable energy, and the scent of ancient books and magical reagents wafts through the air. Cobblestone streets are well-maintained, and the brick buildings stand tall and proud, adorned with intricate carvings and arcane symbols. Students in flowing robes and scholars carrying stacks of tomes pass by, engaged in animated conversations about magical theories and their scientific applications and philsophical discoveries. The use of levitating bits and bobs on statues and fountains gives makes you wonder if the campus came from the future. You get the sense that only the sharpest and most fortunate minds get the liberty to study here.

`GM History Note: ` The University District traces its origins to a group of visionary scholars and educators who, centuries ago, sought to create a center of learning and enlightenment within the city. Fueled by a passion for knowledge, they established the foundations of what would later become a prestigious academic hub. Because of the demands of the `Foul Immigration` the university almost did not survive. Higher education was just not top of mind. However, after the invention of clockwork technology, that sparked a reinvigorated interest in research and education.

This led to great advancement in Elemental Convergence. Elemental convergence allows us to harness the power of elemental forces in innovative ways. This led to the development of elemental-infused materials, advanced energy sources, and the creation of powerful elemental constructs for various purposes. The foul immigration piqued interest in planar studies, given that undead could seemingly crossover so easily from the Shadowfell. Planar travel is still not fully understood, but after the `Great Wheel Cosmology` theory, planologists were able to harness planar energy. This includes creating powerful magical batteries, energy sources for large-scale enchantments, and sustainable magical infrastructure that powers various aspects of the city.
