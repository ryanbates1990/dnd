# Merchant District

At the heart of the city's economic pulse lies the Merchant District, where bustling marketplaces and thriving businesses form a dynamic tapestry of commerce. Towering trade houses, ornate storefronts, and lively avenues characterize this district, creating an atmosphere of perpetual motion and commerce.

The central square, Grand Exchange Square, is a bustling hub of trade where merchants from various walks of life converge. Stalls, kiosks, and traders' tents fill the square with an array of goods and merchandise.

`GM History Note: ` Given the great success of the Clockwork and the Forgeheart districts, the city had much opportunity to trade ideas and weapons/armour for spices, silk, and other sought after resources. The bordering farmlands bring in their harvest for trade. The outgoing roads did become dangerous and filled with highway gangs, bringing rise to the merchant's guild. They started as a group of desperate traders who needed to protect their investments and came up with armored carts/hired swords, and other more crafty means of protected their trade. More modern advancement includes magical communication systems with other cities including scrying pools, and secret routes.
