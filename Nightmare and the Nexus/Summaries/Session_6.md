# Summary

- Purchased a ladder from a man named Dilbert
- Infiltrated a warehouse who's address was found in the firbolg's ledger
- Inside were orcish creatures, the leader of which was named Juice and wore mechanized appendages, who were brewing the potion you found in Bert's apartment.
- After quickly besting the Juice in combat, his followers stood down and looked onward in fear as Harken probed his mind.
- you learned that the potion was a sort of love potion and that the Juice's boss was a dragon named Vlad ( `Note` Let Raiden make a connection here to the polar vale, and that his name is truly Vlad the Stormbringer ) who sat on an opulent throne and on his finger was a ring with a huge black gemstone.
- Additionally, you learned that potions were to be delivered to a popular brothel in town called the bubonic.
- You looted the Juice's body and uncovered a note with a 5 digit code on it and an orcish necklace that will bring the wearer back to 1 hp if you were to be reduced to 0 once per long-rest.
- You went back 9 Finger Nova who says that she is expecting intel on the mayor soon and to come back in a few days. Additionally she offered 2 resources to help with infiltration of the bubonic and to meet them at 7pm ( the following day at The Fox Hole, an inn at the northern part of Humble Haven )
