## History Note
- Undead and other evil remnants weren't behind the screen with the divine quarantine was issued. This creates certain dangers and superstitions.

- for luke's character pockets of undead are quarantined and house Blackburne's woman is a part of a group of drow being harvested by vampyres. His master is locked behind the divine quarantine that is a city state ruled by vampyres. The vampyres rule a slum of drow people kept alive for their blood.

- we will `need churches` dedicated to whatever god put the undead behind the quarantine as gratitude.. however some people may have a 'what have they done for me lately type attitude'

- It seems that the *Great Wheel Cosmology* theory has some flaws. The boys at the astral nexus laboratory have come up with a more accurate mathematical model that can greater predict the relationships between the planes

- could be a river for the forgeheart district to use as a cooling agent? Upsets Druids outside of the city.
