## Actions
**Multiattack.** The dragonborn makes two attacks, either with its longsword or whip.  

**Longsword.**   Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.  

**Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet closer to the dragonborn.

**Breath (Recharge 5-6)** The dragonborn can use its action to exhale destructive lightning in a 10 foot cone. When it uses its breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Reactions
*Parry.* The dragonborn adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the dragonborn must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Traits
**Slavedriver's Authority.** The dragonborn has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks when giving commands or orders to slaves or underlings.

**Equipment**
Whip, Longsword, Leather Armor

- whip is 1d6+3 damage and fears on DC 13 con save if it hits. This whip is dropped and usable as loot.
