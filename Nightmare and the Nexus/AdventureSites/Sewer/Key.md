# The Sewers

## Purpose

- Rael, hungry still for flesh, growing sick of mutated rats, creeps to the surface every once in a while (if he can escape Lolth's gaze) to dine on something more... supple. 

## History

- Rael's lover refused to submit to Lolth who had no patience for defiance, and was eaten.
- In a frenzy, Rael violently raged against anyone and everyone, and Lolth transmuted him into an abomination.
- Rael, turned to a drider, who will not attack players who enter his lair. He wants players to come back and tell the tale to bring a multitude of adventurers to feast off of.
- Rael, after turning to a drider, banished from the shadowfell, traversed back to the material plane, wanting to find acceptance and belonging.
- He found himself beneath the newly developed city of Slygarten and settled deep in the sewers, finding that his presence incited violence and fear in people. He was a monster that needed vanquished.
- However, a small sect of curious minds sought to study him and Rael, desparate for acceptance, allowed them in his presence.
- They were able to study the effects of Lolth's magic, and made strides in their own understanding in transmutative magic.
- They practiced on rats of the sewers, growing them larger and stronger and fed them to Rael who saw this sacrifice as something of worship of him. It was the closest he felt to love since his lover was eaten by Lolth herself.
- The magical waste of the cultists transformations permated the slow drippings of the sewer, creating rivers of slime that mutates that it touches. 
- The cultists, so greedy, accidentally created mutated vermin to strong for them to control and were eaten by their own creations.

# Locations

## 0 - Entrance

Underneath Humble Haven,

> The sewer typically has 2 sides you can walk on with a channel of flowing filth. You see an unfinished section to the sidewalk. The construction looks remarkably worse, and you can see this section where the filth flows and errodes into the stone and has created a quagmire of water and shit. Just beyond it is an alcove that is overgrown with moss and mold but within it, lies a door.

```
I’ve not much strength, but mighty powers,
I guard small hovels and lofty towers,
But if perchance my master leaves
He must secure me to be at ease
```

The answer is a lock and the doors open when spoken.

The door opens to

>  there is a stone staircase descending directly in front of you.
The steps are scuffed and worn by years of use, the stone walls to your sides are
covered in runes and etchings beyond your understanding

Destroyed with much bludgeoning force, but if they do, are immediately faced with 2 [grave rats](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Grave_Rat.md)

## 0 - Lobby

> Once at the bottom of the stairs you enter a large stone, vaulted chamber with 4 rooms, two on each side. The torches along the walls have long been extinguished. This room clearly was once a place where scholars and magic weavers to meet and discuss lofty ideas but now it stands dark & lifeless with the thick smell of death, decay and rot hanging in the air. Wooden tables and chairs lay overturned and old books lay shredded on the floor whilst a green slime seeps from the walls and casts an eerie green light across the room. At the far end of the room you can see the beginnings of an iron spiral staircase heading downwards.

### 1 - Mages Room

> This small room was once adorned with lavish
furnishings that now lay tattered and ruined on the floor, cushions and sofas
used for meditation have rotted into the ground.

If the room is searched the
party will find a tattered piece of paper with part of a journal entry upon
it

> "That beautiful abomination of Lolth, his prophesying works are so important to our quest... His words percolate within my dreams and fuel my imagination like kindling to a fire."

### 2 - Office 

> This sparse office contains a simple desk and
shelves; on which sit old books of various sizes - most of these have begun
to rot and are illegible. On the walls hang various charts and abstract
artworks of occult and esoteric meaning

If the party search the desk they
will find the
[Sword Of Immortal Rites](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/Items/Sword_of_Immortal_Rites.md)

### 3 - Lecture Room

> In this room lines of desks face the front of
a long room and wall hanging line the room with metaphysical, alchemical
and ritual processes explained. As you move to the
back of the classroom you hear a scratching sound and behind one of the
desks are two Grave Rats fighting over the skeletal remains of a human,
they regard you and turn their attention to you.

2 [grave rats](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Grave_Rat.md) attack

### 4 - Barricaded Room

> The door before you is built of sturdy oak and seamed with heavy bands of
iron. The door is locked from the inside.

A `Perception Check of 12` reveals that the room is barricaded from the inside. It can be picked or broken down with a `DC 18 check`.

> Upon entry, you are immediately engulfed
by an enormous swarm of fat black flies that billows out from within. The
stench coming from the room is overwhelming

Players need to make a `DC 11` Con save or be infected with Sewer pox, resulting in stomach cramps and vomiting. You take 1 d6 poison damage and are poisoned for an hour.

> The
foul smell comes from the decaying human corpses that fill the room. There
are broken bottles of wine scattered around the chamber but nothing else
of interest here

### 5 - Spiral Staircase

descends deeper into the dungeon

## Library (and adjacent rooms)

>  Once you reach the bottom you enter a stone chamber much
larger, longer and more ornate than the one you were just in. The dark ceiling is
lined with detailed stone effigies of demons, monsters, apparitions and wizened
old men. There is no natural light but torches line the walls burning with a dark
yellow flame that is clearly of magical origin. Directly in front of you is a stone
bridge which has long collapsed, presumably during the events that overtook this
doomed place. It used to cross an underground river of water but now the potent
green slime flows under the bridge where water once did. On the other side of the
river the room is lined with rows of bookcases and it looks like the bridge was the
only way to get to the library.

The gap is 10 feet. Leaping would require a `Dexterity Roll of 15`. If they fall into the slime, they take a d6 of damage, and roll a d10 and take a mutation from the [slime mutation table](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/Slygarten/Tables/Slime_Mutations.md).


## Library proper

> Once a place of learning and discovery, it now lies empty, lifeless and
foreboding with the stench of death permeating the air. To your left lies rows
of library shelves full of rotten books, their pages long lost. To your right lay
overturned tables and chairs and a passageway.
At the far end of the library is a
speakers pulpit

if the players inspect the pulpit they will discover a small secret
hatch underneath it which leads to a recently carved staircase leading down
into room 6, the Hecatomb

### Alchemists Chamber

> Dusty glass instruments and tubing systems cover a large
desk in the centre of the room, various putrid and darkly coloured liquids still sit in
the containers, remnants of long forgotten alchemy experiments. On the back wall
are storage cupboards and shelves.

If the party search the storage cupboards they
will find
1x Potion Of Healing and 1x [Potion Of Clairvoyance](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/Items/Potion_of_Clairvoyance.md)

### Necromancy Theater

> This spherical room is like nothing you have seen before,
two rows of wooden seats surround the room like an amphitheater and in the
centre is a large wooden table upon which lies the skeletal remains of a human,
bound down by leather straps. The floor is covered with sawdust which is stained
heavily with the crimson viscera of this damned soul. Black chains with various
tools and instruments designed for pain and cruelty, hang from the rafters, gently
clanking together.

If the players search the skeleton on the table they will find
`The Ring Of Mega Therion` upon its finger

### Morgue

> As you enter this chamber the
stench of death overwhelms you, you can
tell from the layout of the six large
stone tables in the room that this
was once the morgue. What need
wizards and philosophers had for
a morgue you can only imagine,
you thought wizards were more
interested in books than bodies.
At the far end of the chamber
is a set of wooden double doors
to a large store cupboard

If the cupboard is open, [3x Tomb Wasps](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Tomb_Wasp.md) flight out past the players and then attack them

## Hecatomb

> There is no light on the small staircase as the party descends downwards, minutes
feel like hours as you feel your way down. Once at the bottom you emerge into a
large hexagonal chamber, approximately 50 feet across and 20 feet high. Rusted
iron braziers stand on each side of the room, the blazing fires sending shadows
dancing across the roughly hewn walls. The room does not look like it was built
by master craftsmen, it looks to have been hacked and scraped into existence by
inexperienced hands. The green slime seeps from every crack in the wall, it feels
like it covers the walls and drips from the ceiling. In the centre of the room is a pool
of green slime which bubbles and writhes as though sentient. Closer to the edge of
the room there is a large 10 foot wide hole in the ground, which looks like it has
been scratched and gnawed out of the earth

As the players approach the green pool, [5x Dark Cultists](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Dark_Cultist.md) come out to speak to the players.

- They studied the abomination, both with intellectual interest but also in reverence. They sought to gain the power to transmute and change at will.
- They used books, forbidden by those on the surface, to communicate with ancient gods (will not say which gods) to help them.
- They built this Hecatomb Ritual chamber as a playce to carry out forbidden rituals
- The final ritual was completed before they realised they could not control the force that they were unleashing.
- within the chamber below, our dread lord roams

The cultists then attack. If their bodies are searched, they only gain a scrap of journal entry

> We only sought to control it...to harness it’s ancient
cyclopean power... to understand it’s inner workings...such power...now I’ve gazed
upon it I feel it tearing apart the very essence of my humanity...it drips through the
cracks in the walls...flows where water once flowed...seeps into the pores into my
skin...my body hums with potential and my skin burns, rendered fat and scorched
bone...we will soon be who were destined to be...

If the players look down through the `larg hold in the hecatomb floor` they can see the drop is about 50 feet. They can see a river of green slime flowing rapidly below and a small platform to the side that they could land on. They may have a rope in an adventurers pack. If they fall they must make a `DC 15 athletics check` or fall in the slime again.

## Sewer Chambers

> Emerging from the shattered remains of the sewer ceiling, it’s brickwork entrance
resembles a gaping maw full of broken teeth. The party finds itself in a high
ceilinged chamber. Despite it’s obvious antiquity and the eroding effects of the
slime, the architecture and cyclopean scale of the vaulted ceilings still impresses.
Gargoyles leer down from each corner of the enormous chamber, their rictus grins
mocking your intrusion upon this silent vault. In front of the party lay two large
sewer tunnel openings, tall enough for two to walk down side my side

### Left Hand Path (vault)

> This sewer tunnel heads a short distance through impenetrable darkness, filth
and sewage lap at your feet before opening up into a small chamber. The far side
of the room has collapsed, with rubble blocking further progress. Built into the
ceiling is a skylight, casting insipid rays of sunshine and shadows across the
floor. Close to the shattered bricks on the far side of the room is what appears
to be a nest. Gnawed documents have been gathered and stuck together with
some excretion or vile effluvia. There are a number of discarded items within
the nest. If the party search the nest they will find the following

- 3x Potion of Healing
- [1x Potion of Heroism](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/Items/Potion_of_Heroism.md)
- a small chest that contains a dead mouse and 8 gold pieces.

### Right Hand Path (Prince of Swarms)
