# The Marsh

> You find yourself in muddy/swampy water that bogs down your feet and makes it difficult to move. The air smells stagnant and still with the sound of flies buzzing.

The players must move 120 feet through the swamp to make it to dry/sturdy 

After 5 turns in the mist the players roll for the mist exhaustion (DC 12 cons)
