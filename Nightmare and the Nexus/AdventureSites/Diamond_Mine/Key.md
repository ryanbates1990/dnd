# Dungeon Themes
- Dark unless lit by natural means or by the dancing shadows
- Most hallways are lined with mine cart tracks that snake and bend around dark corridors.

# Rooms
`First Minecart is available in the Chamber of Shadows`

## Elevator
> Describe as a cage, uneasy to stand in, jolts as it ascends/descends

- Initial position is down and there is a lever nearby. `Does not work if the steam room pipes are destroyed`
- When activated, you can here the steam pipes at work.

## Abandoned Workshop
> The ground is littered with a layer of dust and fallen debris and the air becomes heavy with the scent of damp earth and rust. Wooden workbenches, worn and stained with age, line the walls, each cluttered with abandoned tools and broken machinery. Rusted pickaxes lean against the benches and on one side of the workshop, a faded chalkboard displays hastily scrawled diagrams and notes detailing the construction of minecart components.

- Observing the blueprints allows players to comfortably operate the mine carts and any switches that appear.
- Observing the chalkboard you see a sequence of four symbols, A flame, a fountain, a gust of wind, and boulder.

## Steam Room
> A room that looks like a utility closet, can hear clangs and squeels that seem to come from the depths, like an old boiler heating system.

- Powers the elevator. The elevator will not work if it has no power.

## Chamber of Shadows
> Approaching the chamber you see a lone mine cart sitting next to a set of tracks and as you enter, a breathtaking sight unfolds before you. The walls, adorned with magical crystals, emit a soft, ethereal glow that bathes the room in a gentle luminescence. The crystals cast intricate and mesmerizing shadow patterns that dance across the walls that looks like beings moving as if they were alive. The crystals line the perimeter of the room in 4 distinct colours. Orange, Blue, Red, and White.

- The crystal's glow increases and dims as players move toward/away from
- If a player touches the crystals out of order, the lights dim
- The order to touch the crystals in is - `Red, Blue, White, Orange.`

If the players touch the sequence in the correct order, a light will hover around them and stay with them throughout the dungeon.

## Initial Corridor
> A Fork in the corridors appears and you see two sets of tracks. One veering off that immediately ends in a pile of collapsed rocks. The other winds further through the cavern. As you are careening forth, you can see that the tracks are currently set to collide into the blockage.
- Secret door being hidden by illusion, can be detected by a `DC 15 Perception Check`.

## Secret Barracks
- `Contains 2 sleeping dragonborn slave drivers` [Click Here for Statblock](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Blue_Dragonborn_Slave_Driver.md)
- Contains a pain of ore and gems containing small diamonds worth about 200 gp and a pouch of 120 gold.
- Can sneak with a `DC 12 stealth check`

## Fossilized Forest
> The corridor opens up into a huge hollow space with massive, naturally carved stone columns. You see a petrified forest. Stone trees and plants that look entirely foreign to you, all preserved here in a deep cave. You do see a hollowed out crevice in one of the walls and you see a face in the stone. Additionally the track splits into 2 directions. One on an adjacent wall and the other on the opposite side you guys came in.

## The Ancient Visage
> As you approach the stone visage its eyes begin to glow and you hear a voice emminating from the stoney mouth.

>In shadows deep or sunlight's grace,  
The essence of your heart I'll trace.  
Speak true, reveal your inner plight,  
For goodness thrives in honest light.  

`The players must answer truthfully and state why they are here.` If the visage determines that they are morally reputable, it will advise them to take the adjecent wall passage. Else it will tell them the more dangerous path.

## Paths Branching from the Forest
- one is a pitfall that if traveled in a minecart will collapse and fall 10 feet and take 1d6 damage. at the bottom is standing water that is occupied by a [Gelatinous Cube](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/GelatinousCube.jpeg). The Characters feel that the water is tingly before being attacked.
- The other direction takes them through the dungeon but not without seeing several paths of divergent mine cart tracks that are clearly blocked by collapsed walls.

## Earth Elemental's Lair
- narrow doorway
- 2 pits on each side
- 2 stalagtite  columns
- center is a mound encrusted with large diamonds with broken pickaxes lying next to it

`GM Note:` When disturbed, turns into a large Earth Elemental accompanied by 3 pickaxes animated pickaxes. [Animated Weapon](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/AnimatedWeapon.webp), [Earth Elemental](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Earth_Elemental.md)

**Pits** - when observed, can see a small stream of water with steam rising from it flowing into a serene pool. `GM NOTE: This pool heals players to fool if sat in for 5 minutes`

**Treasure** The earth elemental drops a diamond worth 300 gp

## Pool
- Serene thermal spring that heals players when sat in for 5 minutes

## Room with Current Miners

- Contains 20-30 miners that are restrained to 5 feet movement speed due to a ball and chain.
- 2 of these are related to Max's character in someway, ideally a friend and cousin or something to that effect.
- 3 [Dragonborn SlaveDrivers](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Blue_Dragonborn_Slave_Driver.md) are used to oversee the operation. If the players haven't already gotten the magical whip from the secret room, one of these slave drivers is Elite.
