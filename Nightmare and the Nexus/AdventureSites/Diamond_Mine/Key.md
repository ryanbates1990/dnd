# Dungeon Themes
- Dark unless lit by natural means or by the dancing shadows
- Most hallways are lined with mine cart tracks that snake and bend around dark corridors.

# Rooms
`First Minecart is available in the Chamber of Shadows`

## Elevator
> Describe as a cage, uneasy to stand in, jolts as it ascends/descends

- Initial position is down and there is a lever nearby. `Does not work if the steam room pipes are destroyed`
- When activated, you can here the steam pipes at work.

## Abandoned Workshop
> The ground is littered with a layer of dust and fallen debris and the air becomes heavy with the scent of damp earth and rust. Wooden workbenches, worn and stained with age, line the walls, each cluttered with abandoned tools and broken machinery. Rusted pickaxes lean against the benches and on one side of the workshop, a faded chalkboard displays hastily scrawled diagrams and notes detailing the construction of minecart components.

- Observing the blueprints allows players to comfortably operate the mine carts and any switches that appear.
- Observing the chalkboard you see a sequence of four symbols, A flame, a fountain, a gust of wind, and boulder.

## Steam Room
> A room that looks like a utility closet, can hear clangs and squeels that seem to come from the depths, like an old boiler heating system.

- Powers the elevator. The elevator will not work if it has no power.

## Chamber of Shadows
> Approaching the chamber you see a lone mine cart sitting next to a set of tracks and as you enter, a breathtaking sight unfolds before you. The walls, adorned with magical crystals, emit a soft, ethereal glow that bathes the room in a gentle luminescence. The crystals cast intricate and mesmerizing shadow patterns that dance across the walls that looks like beings moving as if they were alive. The crystals line the perimeter of the room in 4 distinct colours. Orange, Blue, Red, and White.

- The crystal's glow increases and dims as players move toward/away from
- If a player touches the crystals out of order, the lights dim
- The order to touch the crystals in is - `Red, Blue, White, Orange.`

If the players touch the sequence in the correct order, a light will hover around them and stay with them throughout the dungeon.

## Initial Corridor
> A Fork in the corridors appears and you see two sets of tracks. One veering off that immediately ends in a pile of collapsed rocks. The other winds further through the cavern. As you are careening forth, you can see that the tracks are currently set to collide into the blockage.
- Secret door being hidden by illusion, can be detected by a `DC 15 Perception Check`.
