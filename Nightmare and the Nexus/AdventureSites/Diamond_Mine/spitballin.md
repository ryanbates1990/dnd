# Feature Rooms

1. **(Challenge) Chamber of Shadows:** A room where the magical crystals cast intricate shadow patterns on the walls. The shadows seem to dance and tell a silent story. Players might need to interpret the shadows to uncover a hidden clue or passage.
1. **(Fight) Dragonborn slave drivers**
1. **(Twist) Earth Elemental** with animated pickaxes
1. **(Reward)**: Diamonds + a barbed whip of menacing. d6 finesse weapon that has a 10 foot reach and fears an opponent (unless they make a DC 13 wis save) on a hit. 
1. **(Repeat) Buried Visage of an Old God**: Eyes glow when the players enter and they must answer a question. If they answer incorrectly they are damaged by an eldritch power. If not, they are given guidance through the mine via the light of the colored crystals. 

In shadows deep or sunlight's grace,
The essence of your heart I'll trace.
Speak true, reveal your inner plight,
For goodness thrives in honest light.

The correct response would be an honest declaration of one's commitment to goodness, kindness, and moral uprightness. Any attempt to deceive or obscure one's true nature might indicate a leaning toward less virtuous tendencies.

 A room with natural vents releasing steam from the thermal springs deep within the mine. The steam fills the chamber, creating an eerie and mysterious atmosphere. Players must navigate carefully to avoid scalding steam.
