# Laboratory Battlemap Layout:

IMPORTANT!!! At some point show a cosmology map that dismantles the WHEEL cosmology and shows it as a network!!

## Main Floor
- **Size**: The lab can be a large rectangular room (40x30 squares).
- **Centerpiece**: A large planar ship under construction, floating in the middle, with scaffolding and walkways around it (10x10 squares). This would create obstacles and high ground during a fight.
- **Workbenches**: Scattered throughout (each 2x2 squares), covered in arcane tools, glowing crystals, and ship parts.
- **Rift Area**: Towards one side of the room (near the top), there could be multiple cracked rifts (3x3 squares each) into other planes, spilling strange energies or creatures from those realms. One of these might be dangerous terrain, dealing damage if crossed.
- **Power Nodes:** Arcane devices (1x1 square each) placed around the room that could power the ship, used for cover, or manipulated during the fight.
- **Astral Plane Remnants:** Small pockets of floating astral debris scattered randomly, acting as difficult terrain (2x2 squares each).

## Ritual Chamber (5x8 squares)
- **Purpose**: Used for planar rituals and magic experiments.
Description: A dark, circular room with an arcane circle inscribed on the floor, glowing faintly with astral energy. Shelves are filled with arcane tomes, strange bones, and magical components.
- **Gameplay**: The arcane circle can be a trap or puzzle. Characters could disrupt an ongoing ritual or harness its power. Summoning or teleportation magic might function better or worse in this room.

## Artifact Storage Vault (5x5 squares)
- **Purpose**: A locked vault containing dangerous relics or items from other planes.
- Description: Rows of stone pedestals with enchanted containment fields. Some pedestals may hold artifacts from the Feywild, Shadowfell, or the Abyss. A faint magical hum fills the air.
- **Gameplay**: Some artifacts could provide helpful boons, while others are cursed or could even release planar creatures as enemies. This room may also have arcane traps or defensive mechanisms.

## Planar Navigator’s Workshop (7x7 squares)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated to researching navigation in the Astral Plane.
- Description: Charts of other planes, strange 3D models of astral geography, and magical sextants scattered around. A large crystal globe in the center floats, showing a shimmering map of the Astral Sea.
- **Gameplay**: A strategic room for controlling navigation—destroying or using the devices could aid or hinder the Shadar-Kai's efforts to open more planar rifts. This room may also feature a puzzle involving planar coordinates.

## Arcane Generator Room (15x15 squares)
- **Purpose**: Houses the magical machinery that powers the laboratory's experiments and the ship. There are diamonds galore in here.
- **Details**:
    - Dominated by a central, massive arcane generator (5x5 squares), pulsating with energy.
    - Crystal conduits (1x1 squares) run along the walls, connected to the generator. These conduits could be damaged or manipulated to overload and create environmental hazards or traps.

## Specimen Room (8x8 squares)
- **Purpose**: Shows mysterious creatures or even parts of creatures. Some humanoid, some completely foreign and alien
- **Details**:
    - Dominated by a central, massive arcane generator (5x5 squares), pulsating with energy.
    - Crystal conduits (1x1 squares) run along the walls, connected to the generator. These conduits could be damaged or manipulated to overload and create environmental hazards or traps.
