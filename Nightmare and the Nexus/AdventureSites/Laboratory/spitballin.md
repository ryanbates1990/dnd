## Dungeon Features

## Spitballin
- Astral stalker subdued in magical bonds, a lever unleashes it. Evidence of recent carnage.
- Temporal echoes of past experiments manifesting as ghostly apparitions. Maybe fighting ghosts from the past?
- Magical wards triggering alarms or defensive measures when unauthorized individuals are detected.
- Guardian constructs for the entrance.
- Giant ship hanger with ship + lighthouse that projects into the astral plane for safe return.

- This is accomplished through a reskin of the `Magnificent Mansion` spell. The user can close the portal (just making it invisible), thus, the players have to uncover the location it. The spell is cast through a powerful artifact through the power of the ethereal generators and stored behind a `vault` within the lab.
