- Has enchanted basement with an enchanted machine that has different ‘weather’ orbs for different plants
- Scene is overall rustic with some clear sophistication - good at what he does
- is a Firbolg that is fairly dumb, dumb enough for it to be believable that he doesn’t understand his recent buyers are evil
- He has a shed full of craft supplies/expensive and exotic lumber that he uses to build many trinkets in his home/look like he’s doing well
- **Has 2 guard dogs (inside the home)**
- His outdoor garden is illusory and labrynthian… players can see certain paths but may be walking into a wall of thorns for minor damage, become confused (or compelled to tend to the garden via some pixies) etc.
- The firbolgs growing operation is in the basement and can’t hear intruders unless obscenely loud
- A willow tree with a face that is slightly forlorn. It can speak Sylvan and Celstial and is originally from the beast plane
    - If talked to, it misses it’s birth plane and feels this place stunted its growth
    - Says to watch out for the hooded man. He can play tricks on your mind.
    - Knows that the firbolg is a good giant. He loves plants and enjoys the simple pleasures of life

- **When they leave** an innocent person shows up to buy herbs. Says they saw a hooded figure traveling the other direction that stopped to talk to them and asked a few questions
