# The Boobonic

Overall atmosphere:
- air of sophistication
- plush velvet curtains
- rich mahoganny
- trim and furniture has ornate hand carved features
- glass chandelier lit by candle whos flame creates a wave-like shimmer on the ceiling
- soft music
- overall relaxing

## 1. Lobby

- Similar to a hotel lobby where there is a front desk but with more seating
- (a piano plays by itself)
    - `Note` if they 'guide' the piano it will inspire them with a d6 on charisma checks
- spy `Ceril` at the front desk, who every once in a while has pixies flit in and out from the door behind him handing him notes. He takes a glance and files them away
- A dragonborn bouncer guards the hallway to the vip area.


**Ceril Montgomery** is the proprieter
- Slender
- Prominent moustache
- slicked back hair, grey streak off to one side
- maroon hankerchief 
- wears an impressive black jewel on his wrist `Note: adolphus's trademark from the shadowfell (enterred through the diamond mine)`

*Ideal:* I do whatever I can to accommodate guests because word of mouth is the most effective advertisement. Even if it means neglecting my employees.

*Bond:* I came from nothing, I built this brothel from the ground up. It's fame is my fame and I will live on through it.

*Flaw:* I no longer sympathize with the poor, they disgust me. They should work harder for their money.

*Secret:* I have allowed adolphus washington to establish a place to harbor kidnapped girls for a cut of the money. And boy is it a lot of money.

## 2. Taproom

An arched hallway leads from the Lobby to the Taproom which is notably more lively. Patrons can drink and wait for their appointments here. A barman with thick, gray mutton chops serves ale from a very small (never ending barrel). Occasionally a working girl wearing something thin and flowing comes and taps a guest on the shoulder and they go off down a hallway which eventually leads upstairs.

- regulars (sleezy types)
- young, nervous looking men with their fathers
- group of kobolds

people are drinking, playing cards, and occasional regulars are reading

## 3. Dressing Rooms

- mostly just the working girls

## 4. Ceril's Office

- bookcase
- seat facing a desk with a green lamp with gold pull chain.
- painting of a birdseye view of slygarten.

Down a small hallway behind the front desk. Behind a false wall there (that is opened by a sconce lever)
    - a passive perception of 12 will notice that there are 4 sconces in the room but one is not lit
    - perception of `DC 16` will notice a small beetle crawled between the floor and the far wall of the office

- Has a safe behind a painting of the place that requires a `DC 18` to pickpocket
    - 3 beads of fireball on a necklace
    - an ornate dagger
    - satchel of gold
    - scroll of disguise self
- filing cabinet
    - contains letters, notably there are some from adolphus washington which Harken would recognize as an incredibly influental person in the city.

## Hallway by by Ceril's Office

past the dressing rooms and before the storage room is a set of stairs that descends into darkness and is guarded by 2 dragonborn bouncers (named Tharok, and Sylara). the hallway veers to the right so you can't see the guards as a normal patron.

## 5. Utility Closet

## 6. Storage room

- This has alley access and is a locked door with a padlock with a code '30781'. This padlock is enchanted and can't be harmed by physical weapons.
- Locked from the outside, mostly supplies for the bar upkeep, makeups, clothes, etc.
- has a hidden cellar door that opens up to take goods to the vip area

## 7. Kitchen

## 8-15 Upstairs rooms
