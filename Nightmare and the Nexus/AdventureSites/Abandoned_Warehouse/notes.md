# Concept
location: Forgeheart
denizens: Researchers, Alchemical Thug, Hammer Thug, Alchemical Enforcer

They are confronting a group of thugs working for Adolphus Rockwell. They know the following information about their use:
- The potions make someone love you temporarily... You do things for people  you  love, you wouldn't do for other people
- Boss

The place is generally noisy, with bubbling and gurgling of a brewing potion as well as the juicer stocking materials, so some noise can be masked by other things.
A `stealth check of 12` is really all it should take to hide behind the noise at least.

# Treasure
- 4x vials of acid that create 10 feet of dangerous terrain when thrown and a d6 on a hit or when 1st enterring a splash
- Love potions
- 32 gold
- Necklace of orcish resilience (once per long rest, if reduced to 0 hp, can come back with 1 hp)

# Key

## Perimeter

- each entrance has a single [city guard](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/City_Guard.md) patroling the area
- all doors are locked (`DC 10 lockpick. The doors have 20 HP`)

## 1 - Lobby

Door to 4 is ajar and can hear the sound of brutish laughter with a small amount of light creeping into the room. This room is only dimly lit and contains 2 other closed doors.

### Information

If the fight goes extraordinarily well for them
- Will offer a job as delivery, for a 200 gold a week, provides information about guard shift changes at the boobonic, and secret back entrance for shady goods. Says to bring the cart around back and give a pass phrase. The phrase changes each week, so come back for the phrase.
    - If they accept, they need to prove their loyalty somehow (an acid brand)

- **Clue:** boxes with false bottoms, lables addressed to the Boobonic.
