# Dungeon Description

# 2: Digestive Tract

> A curtain of tendrils is the only thing that separates you from a gentle trail of acid trickling down deeper into the cavern. Occasionally you see crystalline outcrops being overtaken by tendrils

The Echoing Void could appear as a dark, starry expanse, with floating fragments of memories—glowing, translucent shapes suspended in the emptiness. These fragments pulse with dim light, showing scenes from the whale’s life. The void calls, asking you to offer a memory or piece of wisdom.

Based on quality of answer, make a persuasion roll against a DC of varying strength, the whale grants passage and +1 sanity on a save. If there is a failure, a tendril stretches from the ground and holds on and won't permit passage (-1 sanity)

# 5: Luminous Reef
> The air feels thick in this room, almost as if walking through water. The Fauna is beautiful, filled with coral and brightly colored, biolumiscent plant life. The plants pulse with the heartbeat of the whale, creating a mezmorizing light show. Some corals are shaped in ancient runes whos meaning has been lost to time.

> Floating Debris: Bits of wreckage from the whale’s past—such as ancient artifacts, remnants of lost civilizations, or even celestial objects—drift through the reef. These remnants could be important for players to explore, as they might hold clues about the whale’s history or serve as potential rewards.

**myconid deceiver in this room**
- claims a parasitic worm has shut off parts of the whale's body, making it not function to 100 percent.
- claims the hallucinogenic properties are part of the immune system
- He claims the fungus is part of the whale's natural fauna and that the parasite is deep within, its a worm of fincredible magnitude
- desperately pleads that the players would lead him into this room. If there's any way. He knows about the expanse in room 3.

agreeing to help him results in -1 sanity

# 6: Flame of Creation

> A person that looks aflame of radiant light, like burning magnesium, lays and looks in pain. He is lying in what looks like a furnace that carries into unfathomable depths within the while. Occasionally he flickers and what looks like sun-spots flash across his body and slowly dwindle.

- he is a flame from the fire of creation, set within the whale from the author of all things.

- he fears he will have to release the seal or die
- if the myconid get to him they can use him for evil

If the players agree to help, +1 sanity

# 7: Pool of Reflections

> Tendrils and patches of Mycelium engulf this vast chamber, but they recede suddenly in a large circle in the center of the room, as if there was an invisible barrier behind which they cannot grow. Within that circle is a large pool and around it are different spiritual beings that stare into the pool. Beyond the pool lies a path to an archway to a chamber. You can hear deep, yet soft pulses coming from the far end of the chamber.

`Gm Note` each spirit being represents pieces of the whales personality that have been a part of the creation of planes.

# 8: Infested Chamber (fight)

> Enterring through the archway you see a room like you've never seen before. The floor and ceiling are covered in cilia, like a plain with tall grass, with 4 huge, cilia covered columns stretching from floor to ceiling. It looks like there once were many columns but have since whithered away, leaving a small mound of decay. The left and right walls are entirely gone, looking at the ceiling is like looking into the night sky with only thin, shimmering veil separating you from the chamber you are in and falling into the void. Periodically a large rush of wind hurls space dust from one side of the room to the other and you can see the cilia grabbing at debris from the air around it.

> At the far end of the room, A giant, fungal abomination working its tendrils violently against a radiant seal, preventing it from moving beyond the whale's astral lungs. It rises and shifts its deep blue eyes towards you and pauses for a moment. He reaches out with a spectral tendril that latches on to your minds. It says in a deep voice, 'Surely you present yourselves as servants of Rhaexorog, to break into the vault and steal the flame of creation, a flame from the fire that out of which came the first things. We shall create for us a world of our own design through the mind of this wonderful host.'

## Environment

- Chamber can breath, pillars that prevent movement. Myconids tethered to the ground are unaffected by the breath
- astral expanse/curtain at the sides of the room that has a time stop feature for living creatures that enter the expanse.
    - when it breathes, space dust flows from one side or the 
    - players that are knocked are protected by the cilia
- Cilia at the floor, ceilings, and columns of the chamber
- 4 pillars, you can see where many more pillars were but have been corroded and worn away

## TPK Prevention

- if a player is knocked, they fall to the ground and the cilia covers them and guards them from taking additional damage. 
    - if a player cannot get to them to save them, the cilia will move them towards the expanse
- if a player is lost into the expance, they appear floating in the astral sea and are provided a bubble from the great whale allowing them to regain consciousness. They can thing talk to the whale about where the want to go.
