The plants pulse with the heartbeat of the whale, creating a mezmorizing light show. Some corals are shaped in ancient runes whos meaning has been lost to time.

> Floating Debris: Bits of wreckage from the whale’s past—such as ancient artifacts, remnants of lost civilizations, or even celestial objects—drift through the reef. These remnants could be important for players to explore, as they might hold clues about the whale’s history or serve as potential rewards.

**myconid deceiver in this room**
- claims a parasitic worm has shut off parts of the whale's body, making it not function to 100 percent.
- claims the hallucinogenic properties are part of the immune system
- He claims the fungus is part of the whale's natural fauna and that the parasite is deep within, its a worm of fincredible magnitude
- desperately pleads that the players would lead him into this room. If there's any way. He knows about the expanse in room 3.

# 6: Flame of Creation

> A person that looks aflame of radiant light, like burning magnesium, lays and looks in pain. He is lying in what looks like a furnace that carries into unfathomable depths within the while. Occasionally he flickers and what looks like sun-spots flash across his body and slowly dwindle.

- he is a flame from the fire of creation, set within the whale from the author of all things.

- he fears he will have to release the seal or die
- if the myconid get to him they can use him for evil

If the players agree to help, +1 sanity

# 7: Pool of Reflections

> Tendrils and patches of Mycelium engulf this vast chamber, but they recede suddenly in a large circle in the center of the room, as if there was an invisible barrier behind which they cannot grow. Within that circle is a large pool and around it are different spiritual beings that stare into the pool. Beyond the pool lies a path to an archway to a chamber. You can hear deep, yet soft pulses coming from the far end of the chamber.

`Gm Note` each spirit being represents pieces of the whales personality that have been a part of the creation of planes.
