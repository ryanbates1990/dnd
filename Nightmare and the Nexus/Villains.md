## Mayor Theodore Blackburne 

He came to power by persuading (financially) a vote to elect from several university memberes who sit on the board of the city. This bribery is kept secret. The Van Green family has suspected this and is desperate to uncover this fact and bring it to light.

has started searching exports for particular outgoing metals that bond properly with a newly discovered metal from the astral plane. This was discovered within the Astral Nexus Laboratory, a laboratory specializing in planar discovery. Mayor Blackburne cut all funding for the project when he took office 2 years ago, however, unbeknownst to the public, he continued operation privately after finding out they discovered a convenient way to enter the astral plane.

His goal of course, is to amass incredible sums of money for his own satisfaction. To do this, his lab needs to be secret, he needs a buyer for resources he uncovers (and for buyers to understand their value), and he needs security.

(From slack, a separate note) Point of inspiration: The evil mayor could be after a means to teleport through the astral plane at will - It turns out he is a shardar-kai in disguise who’s lover is trapped in a ‘quarantined’ demi plane of undead. He means to create a breach in the astral plane and force his way in and release an artifact that is responsible for the planar tether.
- If investigating his home/office he could have a painted portrait of a royal drow lady stowed in a closet.
- His past is generally unknown
- Some of his followers worship the Raven Queen
- He is known in the town to be single
- Think the key is that we need to have reasons why he was persuasive as a ‘new’ political candidate
The undead tower could have several legendary artifacts working together. Wall of Force/antilife shell, etc. Or it could have Godly interference.

Would need to make a key dungeon for his home
