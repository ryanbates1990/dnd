# Dark Cultist

*These men and women are merely shadows of their original forms, some with tentacles or claws for arms, some are huge with grossly distended muscles, and some simply shamble around with their skin melted and ruined by the unnatural effects of the slime. The shreds of clothing that still cling to their ruined forms are different from the bodies you have seen lying in the streets of this place, though. These people look to have worn long black robes with some kind of delicate pattern on the back. Whatever spark of human spirit once dwelled within them has long since vanished, and now theyâ€™re simply terrifying caricatures of their previous selves.*

**Special Ability: Face Melter**
   - *Should the party reduce the cultists to half their number in combat and knowing that death is imminent, the remaining cultists will be overcome by a religious frenzy in service of their liquified primordial lord. They fall to their knees and will begin speaking in tongues, flecks of foam appear at the corners of their ragged mouths, and they will begin tearing at what remains of the flesh of their faces with their wrecked hands and claws. When the cultists enter this heightened state, they surrender themselves entirely to the fury of the slime and become reckless. At the start of their next turn, the remaining reckless cultists can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against them from players have advantage until the start of their next turn.*
