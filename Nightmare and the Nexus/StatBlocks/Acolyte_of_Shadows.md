### **Shadow Step** *(Recharge 4–6)*
As a `bonus action`, Shade can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space they can see that is in dim light or darkness. After teleporting, Shade has advantage on the first melee attack they make before the end of the turn.

### **Cloak of Shadows**
Shade can use their `action` to become invisible until the start of their next turn.

### **Shadow Bind**
Shade can use their `bonus action` to bind a creature's shadow to the ground. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained until the start of Shade's next turn. The target can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to free itself.

### **Evasion**
When Shade is subjected to an effect that allows them to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they instead take no damage if they succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if they fail.

### **Sneak Attack**
Once per turn, Shade can deal an extra 14 (4d6) damage to one creature they hit with an attack if they have advantage on the attack roll, or if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and Shade doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### **Cunning Action**
On each of their turns, Shade can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Actions**

**Multiattack.** Shade makes two attacks with their Shadowblade.

**Shadowblade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 4) psychic damage.

**Shade's Dagger.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

**Reactions**

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that Shade can see hits them with an attack, Shade can use their reaction to halve the attack's damage against them.

### **Backstory and Personality**
Trained in a gang called the gloomy bastards. They seem to move with an almost supernatural grace, blending into shadows with ease. Shade is pragmatic, focused on the mission, and has a dry sense of humor. Though not much for small talk, they are fiercely loyal to those who earn their trust.
