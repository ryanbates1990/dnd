# Tomb Hornet

*The bugs that inhabited the cracks and shadows of this place were not left untouched by the effects of the slime. Creeping from their hives and nests, they evolved in a lethal direction. Spiders, beetles, flies, roaches, and more that crawled in the dark grew to staggering proportions. Tomb Hornets are large wasp-like insects comparable in size to a buzzard or vulture. It's an ugly flying mass of mandibles with a huge stinger at the rear of its carapace. The tomb hornet is parasitic and reproduces by implanting larvae into the skull of a host via its dripping stinger...*

3. **Larval Puppet**
   - *When in combat with the Hornet, every time it successfully wounds a player, the player must make a constitution/strength saving roll. Failure to save the roll means the hornet successfully implants its parasitic larvae into the player, causing D6 Necrotic damage and can control the player until that player can successfully pass the appropriate save. The actions of the pupated player are at the DM’s discretion but would likely be that the player is forced to attack his comrades. In the unlikely event that the Grave Hornet reduces the player to less than zero HP, the hornet’s larvae complete its gestation period and erupt from inside the player's distended skull, spraying bone and tissue everywhere. The wasp then joins the battle.*
