## Grave Rat

Once merely a blight to the folk of this ancient city, the slime has altered these rats beyond recognition. Corpulent and twisted with ragged claws & broken teeth that seethe with venom, these vermin have grown beyond their natural proportions with an appetite to match. Pustules and jagged shards of bone reveal themselves from beneath their matted fur with scant regard for the laws of nature.
