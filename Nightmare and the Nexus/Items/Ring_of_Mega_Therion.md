A thin, ebony ring with a small emerald stone embedded
in its surface which looks to have been worn smooth by
centuries of wear. This ring has 3 charges for each wearer
before it becomes inactive. While wearing the ring, you
can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack
one creature you can see within 40 feet of
you. From the ring the spectral form
of a horned beast is produced and
makes an attack with a +8 bonus.
On a hit, for each charge you
spend, the target takes 3d10 force
damage and is pushed 5 feet away
from you
