Shortsword, rare. This dull, black blade glimmers gently in the light,
humming with magical energy. Upon the metalâ€™s surface, pained faces
emerge then disappear to be replaced by another screaming visage
creating a slow swirling effect. You can use your bonus action
to release a swirling beam of tortured souls to erupt from the
sword, which will cause 2d6 damage to any enemies in a 15ft
line.
