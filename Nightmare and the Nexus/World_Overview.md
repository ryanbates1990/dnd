# World Overview

The world is split between 3 major kingdoms in a time of relative peace. The southern kingdom is more culturally isolated than the northern kingdoms, who trade and integrate culturally and technologically. The borders between kingdoms are much decided by geological difficulties like mountains, rivers, and lowland marshes. However, some scars from previous conflict remain. Cultists originally dedicated to war released powers that they could not fully control and our still lingering and have been given dominion in certain parts of the world. This includes small pockets of undead forces where no normal person travels. Other pockets of land are occupied by untamed barbarism in the form of orcs, goblins, and other creatures. This is typically found in wildnerness.

Northern maps of the southern kingdom are often outdated and while the relationship with the southern kingdom is peaceful, it is not always friendly. They are resistant to foreigners and when ambassadors do return, an unsatisfying amount of details remain. There are rumors of strange religious practices, ancient magics, rituals, and fanaticism. It is unclear why they want to keep to themselves but whatever it is, there has to be something sinister behind it. The western kingdoms have sent ships south to try and uncover truth but either return with nothing to report or they don't return at all.

Elves and Elvish clans typically inhabit the southern kingdom and have a much more ancient history. Humans are found everywhere and other races are distributed less generously about the northern kingdoms. It is not uncommon for cities to be inhabited by significant gnomish and dwarven populations.

# Starting City Overview

The city attracts intellectual minds from all over to study at the local university and subsequently work as engineers and in labs to pay the bills. The city is surrounded by farmland populated by a vastly different group of people. Imported materials are constantly coming in to the city to be used in someone's research. The city does not export much in the way of product, but is an intellectual capital and much useful discovery is used in neighboring plants where designs are actually put into action.

The city has a Mayor and his council. The mayor's predecessor served 3 terms before losing unexpectedly by a slim margin. The recent loser is sorely bitter about it. The mayor is a boisterous and well-liked fellow, but has recently come under some criticism for reducing funding for certain firms research as well as tightening security of exported goods to the point of a search

The farmers on the outskirts strongly dislike the intellectual crowd and visa versa. The Mayor, Mayor Blackburn, is strongly disliked by Van Green and his family. 

The cities entertainment comes mostly from bars/singing. There is a center courtyard/area where people play crochet and throw frisbees. Some of the gardens are grown by the  university. Some of their plantlife has been modified and arcanically infused with properties that allow it to burn for incredibly long amounts of time, resulting in a reliable fuel source, however the plant is tricky to grow and requires constant supervision. 

The university is beautiful with statues of old scholars and mages that patrol the campus. The university, as an effort to protect its students, has installed a few areas with glyphs of the sun (sunlight spell). They take the form of floating, glowing crystals that when touched, shoot a temporary light to the sky
