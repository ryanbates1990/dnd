# Overview
Mayor Blackburne is facilitating research to try and create a method of teleportation using technology in the laboratory to reach the quarantined lands  
- people have been seen going in and out of a lab that was supposedly abandoned
- the lab moves
- silas and the gang keep tabs on those that go in and out of the abandoned lab and are able to provide clues about how to find the lab and gain entrance

# Adventure Sites

# Node Structure

# Questions that need answered
- How does Mayor Blackburne plan to leave the quarantine, is he trying to leave the portal open and bring undead to the material plane?
- What needs to happen for Mayor Blackburne to be able to open the portal to the quarantine. Point of the question is to have a longer 'trail' to the lab for the players to follow - or allow them to find the lab but they aren't effectively traveling across the astral plane. Mayor blackburne is looking for an artifact to be able to connect to the quarantine? Maybe he is looking for a link and needs to steal an artefact from the church.
    - How are the scientists detecting connections for planar travel?
    - Do they have a ship to navigate the astral sea?

# Spitballin

1. Loose cart/cargo has false bottoms. Silas witnesses, tries to persuade characters to come to their safehouse unseen that evening.
    - need to prep Silas's safehouse
        - the gang provides an engineer that they helped build
            - The location of the entrance changes (finding an engineer will help them predict the location).
                - players can identify individuals who are employed, and follow
                - players can predict the location
        - the gang notes that a keycard is used to pass the constructs... but doens't know of a modern one
            - Clockwork Engineer (prep a small lab for this). 
                - `GM Note`: key cards are activated by reading a sequence that shows under laser light and that sequence needs programmed into a construct.
                - A constructs's mind is ran on a 'hum' from the small oscillations of a crystal. A constructs mind is synced with the hum of a master crystal. If the master crystal is found, he can read passcodes that he can create a recognizeable key on.
    - Silas wants to gather information on how to regain access to `Dreese Labs`
        - Adventure site that for sure needs prepped.
    - There are a couple engineers/contractors that hold different information that will help the characters reach farther into the laboratory.
    - the gang can be confronted by mobs/minions to interfere with their progress/bad things can happen to people that they talk to.
        - need a reason to do this though... maybe they are being tracked by someone using locate object on the stone they took from the cart in the beginning?
