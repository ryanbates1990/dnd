### Abilities

**Unnerving Presence (Recharge 5-6):**  
As an action, the Stitched Chef can fix its wild, glassy eyes on a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature is also unnerved by whispers and the faint smell of rotting flesh. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Explosive Spices (1/Day):**  
The Stitched Chef hurls a pouch of volatile spices and alchemical powders at a point within 20 feet. Each creature in a 10-foot radius must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) fire damage and be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.
