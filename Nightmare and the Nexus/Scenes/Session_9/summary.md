# Summary
- We met the new PC's, Yugi, and Castor
- Yugi, who was at the beginning of the session, in Camor, a coastal city, learned some details regarding an artifact he was tinkering with in a library.
    - He learned that it possesses symbols of Amascut, an almost forgotten figure from history, known to be the daughter of Tumekin, a god of the sun, and his wife Elidinis.
    - Amascut was thought to have been wiped out by her rival brother, Icthlarin.
    - It is thought that Amascut was seeking powerful shards of Jas who in its unbroken state, is thought to be responsible the source of all life and magic
    - The puzzle box was originally uncovered in an archeological site of an ancient dessert city, sophanem, which dwells deep in the desert south of Slygarten.
    - the librarian suggested he try and partner with Slygarten's university to uncover deeper truths regarding his artifict.
    - Agreeing, he packed some things for travel and started his journey to Slygarten.
- Castor
    - received a note that slide under his door as he was resting peacefully in Trader's alley, Slygarten's market district
    - The note instructed him to meet a colleague north of the city and came with a map with coordinates marked.
    - he was tasked to eliminate a carriage carrying sensitive cargo and to be ware a sorcerer.
    - the note advised no survivors and no witnesses.
- Bief
    - traveling north of the city to escort Rose back to the tribe, he was met by Tempus himself, who was doubting Bief's ability to lead. How can he lead when he runs from battle?
    - he drew before him a grand vision to test his leadership, that which required a blood sacrifice and standing firm in battle.
    - along side Beif, Castor and Yugi joined him the vision.
    - The party was victorious and Tempus was most impressed and decided to trust Bief a little while longer.

You can imagine the shock the party had after retaining their memory of participating in Tempus's challenge, when the other participants would stand before them on the road. A meeting place that is surely destiny, or divine orchestration, north of the city of Slygarten. Each heading in different direction, but the strings of fate tug at thee.
