### **Physical Description**
Rose is a young Havrani girl with an air of resilience despite her tender age. Her once sun-kissed skin now has a paler, more muted tone, showing the time spent in the harsh city streets away from her tribe’s open plains. Her long, dark hair, usually wild and windswept, is tied in loose, uneven braids, a subtle nod to her tribe’s customs. Her eyes, a deep shade of amber, hold a mix of fear, defiance, and sadness, reflecting the weight of her traumatic experiences. She has a delicate build but carries a strength in her posture that suggests she’s determined to rebuild herself. Her clothing is simple, a mix of city rags and worn tribal garments, symbolizing her struggle between two worlds.

### **Bonds**
- **Bief**: Rose has an unshakeable bond with Bief, the young champion who saved her. She sees him not just as her rescuer but as a symbol of the tribe's strength and her second chance at life. She often looks to him for guidance, though she struggles with feelings of inadequacy.
- **The Havrani Tribe**: Despite her time away, Rose is deeply tied to her nomadic roots. She yearns to reconnect with her tribe’s traditions, but her shame over her past often makes her feel like an outsider.
- **Her Lost Innocence**: Rose is haunted by her time in captivity, and the trauma has left scars, both physical and emotional. She feels a deep need to protect others from the same fate, and this drives her to be suspicious of outsiders, especially city folk.

### **Ideals**
- **Freedom**: Having been enslaved, Rose cherishes the idea of freedom above all. She now believes that every person, regardless of their background, deserves to live a life without chains, literal or metaphorical.
- **Survival**: She has learned through hardship that survival requires cunning, strength, and often, difficult choices. Her experiences have left her pragmatic, sometimes to the point of being cold.
- **Redemption**: While she’s been saved physically, Rose seeks emotional and spiritual redemption. She believes that by helping the Havrani reclaim their homeland or aiding others in need, she can find peace with her past.

### **Roleplay Tips**
- **Haunted by Her Past**: When playing Rose, lean into her internal conflict. She may be quiet, preferring not to speak unless spoken to, or using sarcasm as a defense mechanism. She’s not fully comfortable in her skin and has moments where her fear or trauma shows, such as flinching at loud noises or avoiding physical contact.
- **Struggling to Belong**: Rose often feels like an outsider, both to the Havrani and to the wider world. Roleplay her hesitance to participate in tribe rituals or her difficulty speaking up in group discussions. However, once she starts trusting someone, she may become fiercely protective of them.
- **Cynical but Hopeful**: Rose has developed a deep mistrust of the world but holds a hidden desire to find beauty and kindness in it again. In social situations, she might come across as bitter or dismissive but can be won over with genuine acts of kindness, especially those that show respect for her autonomy and independence.
