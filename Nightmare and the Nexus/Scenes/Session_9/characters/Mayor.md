### **Physical Description**
Mayor Theodore Blackburne is a tall, pale Shadar-kai with angular, almost gaunt features that reflect his otherworldly heritage. His silver hair falls to his shoulders, and his eyes glow faintly with a dim, shadowy light. He dresses in high-collared black robes, blending nobility with subtle hints of a darker, arcane aesthetic. Despite his cold appearance, he carries himself with quiet charisma, which has earned him the respect of the people of Slygarten.

### **Bonds**
- **His Lost Lover**: Theodore is obsessed with finding and rescuing his long-lost lover (yet to be named), trapped in a vampiric wasteland. This quest defines his every move.
- **Adolphus**: His reliance on Adolphus for diamonds to power his astral portal is both a blessing and a curse, as Adolphus holds dangerous control over him.

### **Ideals**
- **Loyalty**: Despite the time that has passed, Theodore is bound to his lost lover, willing to risk everything for a chance to bring them back.
- **Ambition**: His desire to master interplanar travel has driven him to push the limits of both science and magic.

### **Flaws**
- **Obsession**: Theodore's fixation on his lost lover makes him blind to the manipulation and dangers around him, particularly from Adolphus.
- **Hubris**: His belief that he alone can navigate the Astral Plane and achieve the impossible often leads him to ignore the advice of others.

### **Roleplay Tips**
- **Controlled Charisma**: While he is polite and well-liked, there's always an undercurrent of calculation in his words and actions. Play him as someone always thinking two steps ahead, though his obsession can make him reckless when it comes to his ultimate goal.
- **Moments of Vulnerability**: Despite his calm, calculated demeanor, mention or reminders of his lost lover can bring out rare moments of emotional vulnerability, showing his deeply buried pain.
