### **Character Name:** Viktor Mallory

### **Physical Description**
Viktor Mallory is a stocky, middle-aged man with a broad frame and calloused hands that speak of years spent working with machinery and magical devices. He has short, unkempt brown hair streaked with gray, and his piercing hazel eyes convey a mix of intelligence and pragmatism. Often dressed in a smock lined with pockets filled with tools and arcane implements, he wears goggles perched on his forehead, ready to be pulled down at a moment's notice. His demeanor is typically gruff, but a spark of enthusiasm for engineering shines through when discussing his work.

### **Bonds**
- **Loyalty to Theodore**: Despite being hired by Adolphus, Viktor has developed a strong working relationship with Mayor Blackburne and feels a sense of loyalty toward him, often prioritizing Theodore’s goals over his employer’s.

### **Ideals**
- **Innovation**: He believes in the power of creativity and engineering to solve problems, often pushing the boundaries of traditional methods to achieve breakthroughs in the lab.
- **Practicality**: Viktor values results over theory; he prefers hands-on solutions and often advocates for immediate, practical approaches to engineering challenges.

### **Flaws**
- **Cynical Outlook**: Viktor's experiences have made him somewhat cynical, especially about the motives of those in power. He struggles to trust others, particularly Adolphus, and often voices his doubts openly.
- **Tunnel Vision**: His intense focus on engineering can lead him to neglect the bigger picture, sometimes missing the potential consequences of his inventions or the political dynamics at play.

### **Roleplay Tips**
- **Blunt Communication**: Portray Viktor as straightforward and blunt, often speaking his mind without concern for politeness. His lack of social finesse can lead to humorous or awkward interactions.
- **Passion for Craft**: Allow moments where his enthusiasm for engineering shines through, showcasing his creativity and problem-solving skills when discussing projects or facing challenges.
- **Conflicted Loyalty**: Reflect his internal conflict between his duties to Adolphus and his growing loyalty to Theodore, potentially creating dramatic tension in his character interactions.
