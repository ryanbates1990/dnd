### **Automaton Guard**

#### **Description**
The automatons are mechanical constructs designed for both defense and intimidation. Standing at about 7 feet tall, they are crafted from a blend of dark metal and enchanted materials, giving them a sleek yet imposing appearance. Their eyes glow a faint blue, signaling their active status, while intricate gears and cogs are visible through transparent panels on their limbs. Each automaton carries a large halberd in one hand, and their other hand can transform into various tools or weapons depending on the situation.
