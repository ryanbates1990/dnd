Things to keep in mind for the session:

- carriage contains metals with magical properties that seem rare and otherworldly
- There is a device nearby the drop point that connects to a device that the sorcerer in the carriage has. It opens up the portal to the astral lab
- the astral lab is guarded by automaton guards.
- feel free to wing it. You have a table for who speaks in the lab.

- rose should speak and request they travel back to the Havrani tribe.
- The Havrani are horse people/native people, large tents.

IMPORTANT!!! At some point show a cosmology map that dismantles the WHEEL cosmology and shows it as a network!!
