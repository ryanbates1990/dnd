# Setting

A master-bedroom of a widower's home (loft, `GM Note:` he sleeps in the guest bed after his wife died because it made grieving easier). 

The home is lit by the soft glow of oil-lamp light and has smells of candles providing a comfortable atmosphere. There is a small living space, a kitchenette, and two bedrooms. You can plainly see a master living space that is in a bit of disarray with the window open, letting a breeze in. 

`GM Note:` The kidnappers came through a window descending from the roof. They drugged her with the potion as she slept, drug her out of the window in a blanket to blend in with the night ( a cloak of elvenkind ) and left, knocking over a vase with a few roses in it, and left.

# Characters

- **Bart Grimsby (widower)**: salt and pepper hair, neatly trimmed beard, with a sullen look about him. He has tired eyes and has hard, callused hands. He wears a worn apron over modest attire and he moves with a quiet demeanor.

`Gm Note:` Bart met the girl trying to buy bread from a stall at the hearthstone square and was unable to pay. Offered her a place to stay and offered to help her find work. She had been in his home for 6 days.

- **Rose (missing)**: 

# Clues

`Gm Note:` The city has not sent a detective and is 'stalling' with excuses like, our detective is looking into a serious matter in the Atrani district and will need to come the following day.. etc.

- Scrap of cloak with magical properties (elvenkind) torn on a nail on the windowsill
- soaked rug near the bed with strange liquid (crusty rug, yellow color, almost like someone spilled a butternut squash soup on the rug)
- flecks of an herb unknown to you can be found on the rug, on the pillow, and near the window, and on the roof.. as if his tin of whatever it was had busted open
