# Setting

The entrance is a portal of shifting colors, creating an otherworldly gateway for visitors. As patrons step through, a magical chime welcomes them, accompanied by a burst of glittering sparkles.

Inside, the atmosphere is a symphony of illusions and ethereal wonders. Holographic images dance in the air, creating an immersive and ever-changing landscape. 

**The "attraction"** is a maze like series of illusory tricks. There are is a hall of mirrors, and architecture that creates optical illusions about, and there is a slanted room that makes you feel dizzy as you go through it. And all throughout there are performers that cast illusory magic to create strange fey-like creatures and melting paintings and planetarium like ceilings with moving stars and planets.

`GM Note` The most impressive performer is that of a women who presents herself as Mirrabelle in the house of illusions. She is able to duplicate herself and changes shape as a part of the attraction. On-lookers ooh and ah but in reality she is a doppelganger working for Adolphus and seeking housing in the Mayor's home.

**Bar of Phantasms:**
The House of Illusions boasts a unique bar known as the Bar of Phantasms. Here, drinks are served with a touch of illusionary magic, changing colors and shapes as patrons enjoy their beverages.

# Clues

- Backroom contains a locker with Servant Clothes + Keycard to a home in Atrana (The Mayor's estate). (DC 10 to open)
- Investigation reveals 3 different empty coin purses. 1 was slightly ripped and in the trash, one currently holding a small amount of knick-knacks (totems trinkets), and the other had fallen between the wall and a desk. They all have different initials on them/styles, lending you to believe they all belonged to different people.
