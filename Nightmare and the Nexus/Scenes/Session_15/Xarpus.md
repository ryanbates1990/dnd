### **Traits**

**Flyby.** Xarpus doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

**Acid Blood.** When Xarpus takes damage from a melee attack, all creatures within 5 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) acid damage.

**Echolocation.** Xarpus can’t use its blindsight while deafened.

**Shadowy Wings.** Xarpus can obscure its form by beating its wings furiously. As a bonus action, Xarpus can impose disadvantage on the next attack roll made against it before the start of its next turn.

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** Xarpus makes two Bite or Claw attacks.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.

**Acid Spit (Recharge 5-6).** Xarpus spits a jet of acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

**Necrotic Shriek (1/Day).** Xarpus unleashes a piercing shriek infused with necrotic energy. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and are frightened until the end of Xarpus’s next turn. On a successful save, creatures take half damage and are not frightened.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flyby** and **Acid Spit** make Xarpus a high-mobility threat that can attack from range and retreat.
- **Acid Blood** punishes melee attackers, forcing the party to think twice about closing in.
- **Necrotic Shriek** adds a devastating area-of-effect option that can force the party to regroup if they fail their saving throws.
