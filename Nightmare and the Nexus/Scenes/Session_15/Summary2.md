# Summary

- You guys climbed the mountain and met a magical creature that had vulture like qualities to him. He is a Nagpa
- You were able to detect strong magical forces eminating from within his abode
- He claims he is simply studying some powerful magical artifacts
- The Nagpa claimed that he was cursed by the Ravenqueen, along with fellow wizards, hence his form. He claimed he and the other wizards decided they should harness the power of her ritual and take it for themselves, rather than let the Ravenqueen do whatever it was she was going to do.
- The Nagpa was not ignorant to the shard of Jas and claims that Lord Drakan is the item's keeper.
- Some dick measuring resulted in Yugi successfully counterspelling a spell that would render him completely retarded for a month.
- After that, you guys descended and went deep into the mountain through the passage that Vanescula had shown you
- Upon entering, you guys found yourselves in store rooms who's entrances were magical in nature and it held items which a vampire may deem critical in an emergency situation.
- After exiting, you guys encounter a statue of a large gargoyle with an inscription that read "The Yarasa Queen, the last hope for the rats with wings"
- You guys didn't know much about these creatures beyond what you've heard in legends about the shadow fell, and when you did hear about them, they were only mentioned.
- You encountered a chef who appeared to be made of stiched together flesh named Josef, who was barking orders at some ghoulish assistants. You learned that tonight is a feast, and there is a large gathering of vampyres waiting to dine as they watch Havrani slaves battle in the theater of blood for freedom. Lord Drakan watches from his lone balcony atop a spiral staircase from the final chamber of the theater. The only way to him, is through.
- Before you, you stand between in the middle of a grotesque kitchen filled with ghouls serving forbidden flesh, a warehouse full of jars of blood, with young vyres gluttonously sneaking sips as they guard their hoard of havrani blood, and finally the corridor to the dungeon that houses tonight's contestants in the one and only, theater of blood.

## Immediately

- if the party is still, the vyres begin to smell their presence
- guards patrol the chambers, but they are relaxed in that they are more poised to release them into a huge, granite staircase ascending to what could only be the first chamber.
