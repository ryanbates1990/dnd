# GM Recall

## The Wizard in the Woods

- Wizard of the Woods (Silas Krauss)?
  - He discovered the broken limbs off the blisterwood tree and studies the magic woven into it from the shard of jas.
  - He discovered the magic accidentally by playing fetch with an undead dog. When it retrieved the stick it had... ill-effects.
  - compares the effects of animation of the dead being sine... well then blisterwood is the cosine of it.
  - He hopes his study will help him better understand the magic of life and what perpetuates the living/keeping the living from passing into a state of non-living. Seems to be something wildly different when going from death to animation.
  - came beyond the bubble with the help of some friends back home at his university

## BBEG Background

- Lord D:
  - Through conquest, overtook an ancient race, now extinct, called the dragonkin, possessed a shard of Jas. Lord D grew to incredible power and amassed a huge following. He became obssess with holding 'trophies' of powerful creatures and beings and he holds them now in _The Theater of Blood_.
  - The Ravenqueen and Lolth's conflict created a unique opportunity to pass to the material realm with his hordes and bring back incredible trophies. However, he was stricken by a blisterwood arrow, temporarily stripping him of his transcended powers. He was unknowingly betrayed by a scheming Nagpa, who still feigns a friendship with him.
  - Unbeknownst to Lord Drakan though, the Nagpa possesses the stone, using it to corrupt the land and animate the undead.
- Nagpa:
  - Holds a paranoid possession of the shard in a blisterwood dungeon where it obsessively studies it's tomes.
  - He keeps an eye of all dealings within the realm and sends ravens out whenever he is talked about to snuff out gossip or schemers.
  - He uses the power of the shard to sustain the land, wisely knowing that resources are finite.
  - He also is able to read magical histories from the stone and has even acquired some of the ravenqueen's lost memories.
  - He is perched on a blisterwood tree shooting off the top of the mountain.

# Key 1: Tunnel from the mountain

> The air grows cold as you step into the jagged mouth of the tunnel, the light from the outside world quickly swallowed by the dark stone walls. The tunnel is narrow, just about 3 feet wide, forcing you guys to move single file. The faint scent of mildew and iron clings to the stagnant air. There are faint scuff marks on the floor—evidence that something heavy has been dragged recently.

## Entry Checks

**Perception (DC 15):**  
The players notice small, nearly hidden alcoves lining the walls. These were once used to conceal traps but have since been deactivated.
**Arcana (DC 13):**  
There is a faint magical hum—something old but still partially active. A stronger magic presence is deeper in the mountain.

> After walking a short distance you come to a deadend where you see a door hewn from the stone around.

**Perception (DC 13):**  
You can see visible scratches on the floor where the door has been opened, but the wear is minimal, suggesting that this passage is very seldom used.

# Key 2: Emergency store

`GM Note`: This room is hidden by illusory magic from the _other_ side.

> You find yourself in a room that looks as though it has been untouched for some while. It resembles are store room but is outfitted with rations, 2x vials of congealed blood (act as greater healing potion, but take a level of exhaustion), and basic weaponry.

The players can opt to investigate and able to find

- scroll of darkness
- 2 potions of Superior Healing
- a small glyph on a stone - (Arcana DC 15) to tell that it is a glyph of returning, the user will be taken back to this room.
- black cloak - can be activated to block the sun for an hour and then disentegrates.

# Key 3: Corridors

> Beyond the room, you look back to see that the room you exited from is hidden with illusory magic and looks just like the rest of the hallway. Otherwise, it appears that the hallway led to nothing but a sculpture of a large, female gargoyle sitting on a short pedestal that reads, "The Yarasa (large bat like creature) Queen, the last hope for the rats with wings". The hallways are dimly lit by flickering sconces holding half-melted black candles, casting long, wavering shadows across the walls. The stone floors are smooth and cold, showing signs of careful upkeep despite occasional chips and cracks. Faded crimson tapestries depicting vampyres in battle against all kinds of creatures. (If the players examine, they can get depictions of the creatures they may face later) Your every step echoes faintly. The corridor bends around a corner, and you can hear faint clanging coming from beyond.

> Moving around the bend you see a simple wooden door that opens up into a storage room

# Key 4: Storage Room

> As you open the door you can hear clanging and harsh voices shouting commands from the other room.

storage room contains much better ingredients, herbs, things more familiar to a regular kitchen, though still some blood and and some preserved, cured meats from unfamiliar looking cuts of stock.

`Gm Note:` if the players are to linger here, have 'Josef' the butcher shout to one of his ghoulish assistants, "go and find me some ginger and a limpwurt root - quickly now!"

# Key 5: Kitchen

**Perception (DC 15 or free if they go in):** A pulley system to lift trays of food to the next floor (Up above is a room where waitors grab trays and take them to a large banquet hall filled with Vyres, commotion of an MC praising Drakan and Hyping the crowd for today's performance )

> A kitchen that is manned by a grotesque looking creature, he looks like golem if he stood upright, with wild eyes scars and stitches all over his skin. Though he does wear proper chef garb. He is spouting orders to Ghouls that are flitting about as extra hands. "You know how important today is! It is not the night to fuck this up. Now get me a gods damned limpwurt root you brain dead twat!". You can also see a meat locker wide open where havrani hang on hooks as their blood is drained into large vats

`GM Note` Josef is alive because he knows Drakan's shame about losing the shard of Jas and he will expell that information if threatened. He knows who betrayed him.

Ghouls get Ghoul stat block

# Passageway

- contains a stair case that goes up to the back of the waitors room next to the banquet hall
- hall to blood storage room
- hall that leads into the dungeon area where combatants are being prepped

# Key 6: Blood Storage Room

- contains blood vials and some junky vyres that should be guarding the prison combatants taking extra doses

# Key 7: Dungeon

- horseshoe shaped dungeon full of cells, being watched by burly vyres, some are being scoffed at and mocked. Some are solemn, others are antsy and pacing and slashing with their weaponry.

They know their fate, they are fodder for the theater. They are purely entertainmenet to splatter their blood and whet the appetites of vampyric onlookers. Their only hope is to take down one of Drakan's trophy pets on their way out. A fuck you that he might actually feel.

- They know that Lord D sits beyond the theather, at the end of the hall, and he is alone. His throne sits high beyond the others.
- The thing that separates the other vampires and Lord D is a walk through the theater, a series of battle chambers filled with monsters.

# Theater of Blood

Each contestant is announced by an MC and above them flies a banner.

Vanescula and Ranis have their own balcanies, surrounded by a few tough looking Vyres. They look favourably upon the party

## Lady Salvele - Princess of Gloom Hollow of the Shadowfell

- If she sees Teddy, she recognizes him. Teddy wants to give her a the glyph of returning if they have it.

### Description

Once a radiant Shadar-kai noble, Lady Salvele now stands as a tragic testament to the twisted beauty of the Shadowfell, now Chained to a huge marble pillar from the center of a blood fountain (adamantium chains). Her alabaster skin is marred with faint scars that map her torment, yet they only seem to enhance her unnatural elegance. Midnight-black hair flows like silk over her shoulders, framing a face both hauntingly beautiful and devoid of life’s warmth.

Her eyes—once glimmering with curiosity and power—now shimmer a dull, crimson hue, locked in a perpetual state of wearied sorrow. Her lips, deep red like bloodied velvet, betray her vampiric nature, though a hint of sadness lingers at the corners of her smile.

Her body moves with a ghostly grace, draped in flowing, tattered shadow-silk gowns that cling to her frame, stained with the dust of forgotten ages. At her throat rests a delicate choker, once an heirloom of her Shadar-kai lineage, now corrupted with a dark gemstone pulsating with faint necrotic energy.

Salvele’s presence exudes a magnetic yet suffocating aura, as though she stands balanced between death and desire. Though she retains the majesty of her former life, her posture—slightly hunched, with wrists bound by ethereal scars—tells of a once-proud ruler beaten into servitude.

### Personality

Lady Salvele’s will is fractured, caught between her fading Shadar-kai pride and the vampiric curse that enslaves her. Her speech is melancholic yet noble, with an aching undertone of hope lost. She may seek to test those who meet her, gauging whether they are worthy of ending her torment—or becoming her next victims.

**Ideal:**  
Freedom from bondage, even if it comes through destruction.  
**Bond:**  
Her heritage and her lineage as a princess of Gloom Hollow are sacred. She will not see them forgotten.  
**Flaw:**  
The vampiric bloodlust often overwhelms her will, plunging her into terrifying savagery.

### Dialogue for Salvele and Teddy

#### Salvele

"By the Raven Queen’s shadow… could it be?"

Her eyes scan his face, desperately seeking familiarity beneath the years and pain.

"You stand before me now as if you were a dream. It has been lifetimes since the light touched me, and yet… you have not faded."

A long pause. Her voice drops into a trembling whisper.

"Do you still remember me as I was, when we danced beneath the withered stars of Gloom Hollow? Or am I merely a shade to you now—a forgotten specter of the past?"

#### Teddy

"Salvele… even in this cursed place, I would know you anywhere. You were the brightest spark in a world of fading twilight. And now…"

He falters, taking in her vampiric form—the wounds, the scars, the unnatural life coursing through her.

"They have stolen you from yourself. But not from me."

His voice strengthens, touched with an old resolve.

"I remember the old ways. I remember our vows. Even if this place has drowned you in darkness, I will not let it claim your soul."

#### Salvele's response

"You speak as if you could free me, but the bonds run deeper than you know. They chained me to despair, and I lost my name to the echoes of time. There is nothing left of the woman you loved, save for her hollow reflection."

Yet a flicker of hope—barely visible—flares in her gaze. Her tone shifts, quieter, softer.

"But perhaps… you are the one thing I could not forget. You are the thread I never severed, even in death."

## Bloat

- looks similar to the kitchen chef from the basement. A stitched creation using the body parts of different races such as ogres and cyclopes.

## Xarpus - King, and last of the Yarasa

- looks similar to the gargoyle in the basement

## Lord Drakan

- use vampyre statblock with extra hp (he is a glutton, afterall)
- Ranis and Vanescula will approach after the encounter is initiated.

- He wants Bief to be the next Trophy in the theater. His Havrani blood will taste sweet, and his body a spectacle, and people will love to see him die a thousand deaths.
