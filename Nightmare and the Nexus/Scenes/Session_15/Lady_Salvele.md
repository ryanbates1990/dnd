### **Traits**

**Shadow Step.** As a bonus action, Lady Salvele can teleport up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space she can see that is in dim light or darkness. She has advantage on the first melee attack she makes after using this feature.

**Regeneration.** Lady Salvele regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function until the start of her next turn.

**Vampiric Resistance.** When Lady Salvele fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead (recharges on a short or long rest).

**Spellcasting.** Lady Salvele is a 5th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** Chill Touch, Prestidigitation, Minor Illusion
- **1st level (4 slots):** Shield of Faith, Command
- **2nd level (3 slots):** Mirror Image, Hold Person
- **3rd level (2 slots):** Vampiric Touch, Counterspell

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** Lady Salvele makes two melee attacks.

**Shadowstrike (Longsword, Vampiric Weapon).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 10 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

**Life Drain (Recharge 5-6).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.  
_Hit:_ 21 (4d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and Lady Salvele regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

**Charm (Vampiric Gaze).** Lady Salvele targets one humanoid she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see Lady Salvele, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by her for 1 hour, or until Lady Salvele or her allies do anything harmful to it. The charmed target obeys Lady Salvele’s verbal commands.

### **Reactions**

**Parry.** Lady Salvele adds 3 to her AC against one melee attack that would hit her. To do so, she must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

This stat block makes her a deadly, agile fighter with vampiric abilities and a few potent spells. She can dominate foes with charm, heal with necrotic damage, and teleport with Shadow Step, making her unpredictable in combat. Her tragic nature as a cursed figure also leaves room for redemption, depending on the party’s approach.
