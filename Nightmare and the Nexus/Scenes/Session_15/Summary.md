# Summary

- After recovering from the aftermath of defeating a couple death knights and their hounds, you proceeded onward to liberate another camp
- On your way, Venescula, sister of Lord Drakan, and a pack of wolves stood in your way. She was seen fiddling with the totem that the Havrani boy possessed which he claimed would lead him to a maiden in the woods.
- Harken blasted her with a Dawn spell but was quickly munched on by wolves and passed out
- Venescula insisted that you guys have a mutual interest in taking down Lord D, but could not allow you to liberate the camps.
- She told you that Lord D rules with gluttony that will destroy all humans in their bubble and that this will ultimately destroy the vampires. She wants to usurp and rule in a more sustainable, symbiotic fashion. This of course means the tax man will still exist.
- This upset some of the party, which responded by trying to marry Bief to Vanescula, who was seemingly uninterested.
- She believed that she could help you circumvent traveling through Darkmeyer if you could find an alternative entrance into castle Drakan.
- You eventually obliged to travel with her, who did not allow you to rest beforehand.
- Eventually a clearing allowed you to see a largely barren and rocky mountain with 1 large tree jutting off the peak, and for the second time of the session, you spied a group of carrion birds.
- She showed you a tunnel entrance on the side of the mountain. Darkmeyer sat on the other side of that mountain.
- She suggested you visit a wizard before taking on Drakan. She pointed you in the right direction and left you alone.
- The wizard, a human named Silas was his name, lived in a patchwork cabin exhibited his ability to blow the place up if there were any funny business, but other than that, welcomed you in.
- He held different varieties of undead in cages with mobiles of blisterwood of different sizes, and one with none. He claims the wood from the top of the mountain has a disentegrating effect on the undead, undoing whatever animate magic is taking place.
- He takes interest in you guys and pleads for a vampyric specimen and outfits you guys with some of his handcrafted blisterwood weaponry
- You guys began to venture off towards the mountain pass to take on Lord Drakan
