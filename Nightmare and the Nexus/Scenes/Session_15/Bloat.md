### **Traits**

**Aura of Pestilence.** At the start of each of Bloat’s turns, all creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success.

**Necrotic Flesh.** When Bloat takes damage from a melee attack, the attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces Bloat to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, Bloat drops to 1 hit point instead.

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** Bloat makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 18 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Staggering Crush (Recharge 5-6).** Bloat slams the ground in a 15-foot radius around it. All creatures in that area must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.

**Hurl Noxious Chunk.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target is blinded until the end of its next turn.

### **Legendary Actions (3/Day)**

Bloat can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn.

- **Lurch.** Bloat moves up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Swat.** Bloat makes a Slam attack against one creature within 10 feet.
- **Pestilent Burst (Costs 2 Actions).** Bloat releases a burst of noxious energy. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage.

**Design Notes:**

- Bloat’s grotesque nature and unique construction are reflected in its noxious abilities and necrotic damage aura.
- Its **Aura of Pestilence** and **Hurl Noxious Chunk** can make positioning a strategic element for the party.
- **Undead Fortitude** adds to its resilience, fitting for a boss that players will likely target with powerful attacks.
