# Characters

**Mariah** is red-headed dwarf with two long braids that almost reach the ground. She wears blue overalls and appears in good shape with sturdy shoulds and burly forearms. She is seen unloading inventory of general goods that are sold in the welcome booth and when she sees you she drops a box with a huge clang and greets with an exuberant, "Heyyy how are ya, how are you doing this fine morning?"

- she wants to point the characters where they want to go
- if asked a bit of information she can't help but gossip
- She loves her city and wants her kids to work for it too, it provides a good safe life, and she's got all the friends she needs here in humble haven.

# Setting

> You and your traveling partners have journeyed several days now through Carthag, the region known to most of the world for its Olives, figs, grapes, and an assortment of grains. But you don't care about any of that shit. You didn't suit up and walk 30 dusty miles in this blistering heat for no figs. You guys have goals. Real goals. I'm not talking about just reaching the gates of Slygarten, the richest city in all of Carthag and then some. Yeah it might be rich in opportunity, and maybe you'll make out pretty good and bring back a bag or two. You're going to Slygarten because people know stuff there. And all of you are trying to do shit you don't know how to do, or where to do it. Whether it's uncover the wherabouts of villain of your past to seek sweet revenge, or find your way in to to an impassable place, or figure out how to talk to that handsome dude that's been eyeing you across the bar. You know that the keys to your success are just on the horizon.

> As the city comes into view you see the white walls with green creeping vines stretching up over significant portions of it. You cross the final stretch of farmlands passing the occasional gated-homestead. There are plenty of bustling peoples working the land or taking a break chatting to neighbors over wooden fences. People poor in and out of the southern gate which has on each side, a unique horse rearing back on its hind legs. 

> You step through and while there are guards, they don't seem to pay much attention to the general foot-traffic of people going in and out. The city seems to built around a rather impressive hill with grand buildings that seem almost monumental. Your immediate surroundings however... not exactly eye candy. Most of the buildings are medium-sized wooden buildings that look well-worn and dusty, though not without clothing lines stretching across the alleyways to the other buildings. To your right, looking eastward, you can hear distant clangs of hammers and smoke billowing towards the sky. You smell a mixture of hearty meals being cooked with spiced meats, manure, and body odor. And finally, right in front of you, is a welcome booth
