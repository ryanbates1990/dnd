# Session Start
# Fox Hole

> You first notice creaky wooden floors, and the aroma of simple, hearty meals wafts from the small kitchen. The communal area features mismatched tables and chairs, and a roaring fireplace in the corner provides warmth and a comforting crackle.

> You notice Harken's face is starting to form rather aggressive wrinkles. Crows feet, laugh lines, etc. He has always been thin and looked on the 'unwell side' but in the dim light  of this inn you are noticing for the first time that he looks 45-50. Some lines you can discern are new just since the time you've known him.

- Innkeeper is Old Maggie
- Rooms are available for a modest 3 silver piece per night, offering a basic but clean space with well-worn quilts and a washbasin.
- The menu consists of hearty, affordable fare â€“ stew, bread, and simple ales.
- Named patrons: Gruff, Lily, Tom, Greta, and Little Jake.

`GM Note` Jean and Lock both have [Acolyte of Shadows](/Nightmare%20and%20the%20Nexus/StatBlocks/Acolyte_of_Shadows.md) stat blocks. They are both trained as gloomy bastards with 9 finger nova as one of their garristras

> You see two gentlemen gesturing your attention

they will quickly usher you upstairs to talk in a room for more private discussion
