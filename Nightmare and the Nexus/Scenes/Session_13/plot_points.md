# Summary

largely refer back to the plot points of session 12 and if you need more, those should be here.

## Vampire Notes

- They did not cast shadows, had no reflections in mirrors, and moved in complete silence. Sages claimed vampires retained their souls after turning
- Decadent behavior/enjoy the finer things.
- Don't like running water or sunlight or radiant damage
- They regenerate at their resting place

# Camps

## Fresnen's camp

- small quarry used to extract building materials.
- he escaped and since then, several havrani have been slayn. Ira was able to escape by causing a large boulder to fall upon the vampire overseeing the camp and several drow. This caused a panic and ira escaped.

- There remainsa vampiric mist that haunts the area and 1d6 drow that attempt to keep the humans at bay and have slayn 2 or 3 to try to make that point

Populated By:
    - 15 Havrani slaves
    - 4 drow (2 slayn)
    - vampiric mist
    - ( currently away, a troll + 2 drow drivers)


# Main Camp

    - 1 Troll for moving carts of stone
    - 8 drow with whips/clubs
- contains storehouses, sleeping arrangements, vampire lives in an ornate tent with his dog. 

# Lord Drakan Notes

- Created the blood tithe
- Lives in a Castle within the walls of Darkmeyer
- Is the 'acting' ruler, though covets still the power that remains within the Nagpa's tower. He does not know it is the stone that animates/haunts the land and gives them power, though he is away of an empty plinth deep within a mine. It's original bearer is unknown, but he seeks godhood.
- loathes vampyric complacency with the tithes and values 'the hunt'. Captured trophies remain alive in the 'theater of blood' as sort of a gladatorial prison.

# Nagpa

- animate the dead and control the land using the shard of jas. It is held in the tower. It is hidden in case they entreat guests.

1. Nagpa (possess shard of jas)
2. Lord Drakan (brother Ranis and sister Vanescula as well)
3. Vampires
4. Death Knights (powerful, but mindless thralls)
