# Summary

- The party discovered a small boy (Fresnen) making a panicked escape from the woods. He was fidgety, seemed distracted, and claimed that he had escaped from a labor camp deep within the woods. He carried an artifact that he believes would lead him to a maiden in the forest that will protect him
- He was tracked by a knightly thrall and his skeletal hounds which you guys killed and stole his horse
- A feral Havrani approached you guys and led you to his shelter. You guys were not able to establish trust but before you killed him and several others you learned the following information:
    - There are more knights
    - Havrani are kept in labor camps and owe a blood tithe to vampiric overlords, Lord Drakan being above the rest
    - There are more geurilla Havrani, he claimed they are fittest of all.
    - The Havrani escapee's wanted to hijack a food supply caravan from one of the nearby camps knowing that it would mean the human inhabitants may suffer. They claimed they were lost causes.
- You guys, having shown to be untrustworthy by not helping with their desperate need of food, were attacked by several Havrani in the trees, which you guys dealt with.
