## Session Begin

> You guys, bruised and bloodied but relatively ok, look upon the monsters now totally lifeless at your feet. You look at your new party members and you can see what looks like glimmers of hope in their eyes. A hope that says, "maybe we really can be free"

> At that moment, one of the Drow, dwarfed by the troll behind him, says, "There's no going back now. Lead the way"

## Vanescula

> Out of the mist crops up many sets of red glowing eyes set upon snarling faces. You can immediately see 9 wolves barring down on you before they halt and take a poised, aggressive stance. From the middle of them emerges a very alluring vampyre with porcelain-pale skin. She has long, jet-black hair that cascades in skily waves. Her gothic dress has very sharp, aristocratic features. Her crimson eyes glow, giving off an aura of hypnotic beauty.

> "Let me allow to suggest your next move"

`Gm Note`: quick run down on her personality
- cold, and arrogant.
- she wants her brother dead for her and her other brother Ranis to rule. They fear for their blood supply running out after coming to the conclusion they may run out of resources.
- She wants to cultivate more civility in her subjects and to rule something rather than bloodless husks.
- "Anyone can rule over a corpse, I want to rule over a kingdom"

### Vanescula's information

- If questioned about her knowledge, she can withdraw the little totem that the havrani boy was carrying around and she can say, "I have creative ways of keeping track of things" as she pockets it.

- She demands they do not go to camps, lest they provoke Lord D's attention. He is distracted with other matters
    - He must be dealt with secretly, or he will release overwhelming numbers at you
- She is Lord Drakan's brother
- She wants to rule over a kingdom, not a corpse. Drakan's gluttony will leave nothing left and everyone will pass away into dust.
- She wants Lord D dead, can't do it on her own because she would need an invite
- She wants the Havrani to thrive a little bit.
- There is a wizard in the woods who's made a small laboratory and may have weapons that could be beneficial in taking down Lord D.
- She and her brother could assist with passage in some way?

# TODO
- Wizards House
- Provide quick run-down of a few paths to Castle Drakan
    - down the middle solves the riddle
    - some other way (Probably the biggest TODO ?)
    - maybe quick pass on what Lord D's castle looks like
    - ie: what do the vyre-watch look like/stat blocks. Zombie Hordes? Some other fun, caged monster?

# BBEG dealings
- Lord D:
    - Through conquest, overtook an ancient race, now extinct, called the dragonkin, possessed a shard of Jas. Lord D grew to incredible power and amassed a huge following. He became obssess with holding 'trophies' of powerful creatures and beings and he holds them now in *The Theater of Blood*.
    - The Ravenqueen and Lolth's conflict created a unique opportunity to pass to the material realm with his hordes and bring back incredible trophies. However, he was stricken by a blisterwood arrow, temporarily stripping him of his transcended powers. He was unknowingly betrayed by a scheming Nagpa, who still feigns a friendship with him.
    - Unbeknownst to Lord Drakan though, the Nagpa possesses the stone, using it to corrupt the land and animate the undead.
- Nagpa:
    - Holds a paranoid possession of the shard in a blisterwood dungeon where it obsessively studies it's tomes.
    - He keeps an eye of all dealings within the realm and sends ravens out whenever he is talked about to snuff out gossip or schemers.
    - He uses the power of the shard to sustain the land, wisely knowing that resources are finite.
    - He also is able to read magical histories from the stone and has even acquired some of the ravenqueen's lost memories.
    - He is perched on a blisterwood tree shooting off the top of the mountain.

- Wizard of the Woods?
    - He discovered the broken limbs off the blisterwood tree and studies the magic woven into it from the shard of jas.
