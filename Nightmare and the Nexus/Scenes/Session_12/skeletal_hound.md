### Traits

#### **Pack Tactics**
The bloodhound has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the bloodhound's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### **Keen Smell**
The bloodhound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

#### **Undead Fortitude**
If damage reduces the bloodhound to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken. On a success, it drops to 1 hit point instead, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.

---

### Actions

#### **Bite**
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

---

### Tactics
- Bloodhounds work in tandem to harry and surround the party, using **Pack Tactics** to increase their accuracy.
- If they sense a weak or isolated target, they attempt to knock them prone with their **Bite** to allow allies to swarm.
