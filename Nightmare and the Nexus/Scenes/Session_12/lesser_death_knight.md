### Traits

#### **Undead Fortitude**
If damage reduces the Lesser Death Knight to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken. On a success, it drops to 1 hit point instead, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.

#### **Aura of Fear (1/Day)**
As a bonus action, the Lesser Death Knight emits a frightful aura. Each creature of the Knight's choice within 15 feet that can see it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
