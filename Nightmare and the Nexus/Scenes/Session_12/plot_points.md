- I like the idea that they are ambushed by havrani people and need to gain trust by destroying a caravan of traveling undead.. maybe a troll with a vampire + a couple skeletons.
- I like the charismatic, trap of a spider encounter (Encounter 10)
- Encounter 11 is perfect - liars line the roads..
- Could do the tree one right into the spider one too?

Think we do Encounter 11, Havrani ambushers take notice and lead them.

# Encounter 1:

> child rustling in the woods making a panicked escape

- name is Fresnen
- The artifact the kid has is a palantir that the nagpa can speak through and get his location. 
- His parents sacrificed so that he could escape his labor camp, but he is in great danger.
- he is being chased by a lesser deathknight and 2 skeletal hounds
- he plucked the palantir from an unarmed guard that used to rule his camp. He was a vampire. This vampire is now a `vampyric mist` who longs for his corporeal form.

it is foolish for Ira to be running, he will surely die. He is convinced the palantir will lead him to safety, an illusory image of the nagpa

If the players choose to talk to the Nagpa, they must make a wisdom save of 17. If the fail they see an attractive woman, a maiden of the forest providing direction to 'safety'. If They fail they see a skinless head of a vulture like creature, with deep orange eyes peeping out from beneath a dark purple hood.
    - he wants to lead players to a nearby camp of vampires.
    - the nagpa hosts this army in wait for the ravenqueen to finish her off.

# Encounter 2:

Havrani come to rescue/insight the players about their dealings.. To gain trust they need help for resources and anticipate a caravan of food being transfered to a camp of vampires that rule over laboring humans. 

- The food would be cut off from the humans.. but they would argue the humans are too far gone/don't want to be rescued out of fear of punishment.
    - Teddy might insist to see if any shadar kai or also being used for forced labor.
- The caravan consists of a troll and 2 drow

If the party would refuse, the Havrani may attack if they are not thoroughly convinced that they are not aligned with the nagpa.

- `GM NOTE` Teddy's girl is a slave that performs for Verzik's theater.

- The Havrani suggest an 'up front' approach which will be likely deadly... or find an alternate route into the walls which may involve persuading the help of creatures within the forest. There are other Havrani survivors that grew to be more aligned with the evil forces of the forest. Some remain neutral aligned with powerful allies and features... but they are often, untrustworthy

# Encounter 3:

Eryndel (beastmaster to a camp), keeps some livestock as well as some dogs, large spiders, giant snakes.
    - would lead them entirely into a spider's cave expecting them to die to take their things for his own protection/greed.
    - asks for small payment (which is a lie, he expects to take everything)
    - he has equipment that is clearly not of the forest and is suspiciously gained.
        - black spikey shields, plate armor, ornate daggers, white and black gems, etc...
    - He has made his living trapping and luring vampires and other ghouls, making this area of the forest largely avoided due to the geurilla like nature of this particular camp.

Madame Aelira, who has begun the process of becoming a hag.
    - experiences partial undeath, allowing her to live extremely long. She earned this and was allowed to live by turning in escaped Havrani.
    - She regrets this, but given her gift, she does experience some power and is generally left alone.
    - She is, however, genuine in her longing for the land to be cleansed, seeing it as an opportunity for some sort of redemptive arch for her.
    - that being said, she wants to help the players, but to ensure servitude, will poison the players with a delayed poison...
        - the cocktail will also show them a path to an underground storehouse the vampires use to store 'extra' blood from victims (this would be overtaxing and would anger the nagpa if they found out)
    - Could be shown that the 

The other croud of the camp's members look rough, and are primarily geurilla fighters that are servants of the other two. They often fight and bicker and are almost feral like.

# Another possible Encounter:

Aelira the vistani seer. vs the spider queen envoy

# If they choose hack n slash???

They would first be met by the farms outside of darkmeyer, led by drow.

Then, they would meet a large, stony gate guarded by a troll and some drow guards.

Darkmeyer itself is just like rs, super shitty, vampires lurking, etc.


## Havrani encampment

- camouflaged tree houses/bunkers
- communicate with owl/bat squeaks
- they have to steal/farm rats/rodents to eat.
- they can use fires in certain circumstances, the mist reduces visibility to the flame, but the smell can be a problem they need to cover up
- children are kept in bunkers to keep them quiet, trained in early childhood the art of stealth.
