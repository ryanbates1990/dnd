# Summary
- Yugi, finding reason, appeased the other members of the party and decided to help to defeat the fungal overmind
- It was a narrow victory, but you guys were able to rid the whale of its parasitic infestation, allowing it to remove the seal that was slowly extinguishing its flame
- The whale passed on a few promises, bits of knowledge, and a pendant of dawn that allows the user to cast Dawn once per long rest.
- After a long ride in the ship where an agreement was finally met regarding an argument about vetoing wreckless violence, you finally breached the bubble.
- You arrived in a bog that seemed to have pangs of undeath, and a mist that seemed to sap your vigor. From which, you currently all suffer a level of exhaustion, but you safely escaped the bog.
