# Castor Sunsliver

Within the heart of Trader's Alley in Slygarten, in the Gilded Quill Inn

> Lying on a four poster bed, in a room whos walls are plastered with a warm, ochre hue, giving the room a sunlit appearance even in the dim evening light. Decorative tapestries, depicting scenes of trade and travel, hang on the walls, a nod to the district’s mercantile nature. 

> The window is slightly ajar, allowing the lively sounds of the marketplace to drift in—snatches of conversation, the clink of coins, the creak of wagon wheels. Through the arched window, Castor can see the sprawling Grand Exchange Square below, teeming with activity even as night falls. Lanterns illuminate the stalls and kiosks, and the flicker of torchlight dances across the square’s cobblestones, creating a mosaic of light and shadow.

> At this moment, a letter slides in through the bottom of the door

## The Letter

To Our Esteemed Agent,

Your skills are once again required in the shadows where you work best. A caravan will soon depart from the Northern Gate. This caravan is thought to carry precious metals of unusual origin and immense value. These metals are sought after by forces that disrupt the balance we strive to maintain.

Your task is clear:

Intercept the caravan.
Eliminate all who accompany it.
Ensure that no trace of this operation remains.
It is imperative that this mission is carried out with the utmost secrecy. No survivors. No witnesses. The cargo must not fall into the wrong hands.

You will find that the caravan is lightly guarded, but appearances can be deceiving. Intelligence suggests that the convoy is led by a sorceror, known for his ability to traverse both the physical and astral planes. He is not to be underestimated.

You will not be alone. Marked on the map below is where you will meet your colleague.

We trust in your discretion and skill.

Quem, The Guiding Light
Order of the White Witch
