# Exposition
Setting:
>The ancient camorri library is a vast and dimly lit chamber, filled with towering shelves of ancient tomes, scrolls, and relics. Dust motes float in the golden shafts of sunlight that filter through stained glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the floor. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and leather bindings.

> Yugi is seated at a heavy oak table near the back of the library, surrounded by open books and scrolls. (Have Luke describe his character's appearance) In their hands, they are carefully examining a small, intricate artifact—a puzzle box adorned with strange hieroglyphs and an ominous symbol. This symbol, though unfamiliar to most, has caught the attention of the librarian.

The Gentle Librarian (Eldra):
> An elderly librarian, with a kind face framed by wisps of white hair, notices the PC's intense focus on the artifact. She approaches quietly, her soft shoes making almost no sound on the stone floor. Her voice is warm and gentle as she speaks.

Librarian:
"Ah, I see you've found something quite interesting. That symbol... it is not one that many would recognize. But you, my dear, seem to have a keen interest in the obscure and forgotten."

The librarian adjusts her spectacles and peers at the puzzle box, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studies the symbol.

Librarian:
"This is the mark of Amascut, a creature of great power and even greater ambition. You see, Amascut was said to have been created by Tumeken, the god of the sun, and his wife, Elidinis, the goddess of fertility. But unlike her divine parents, Amascut sought not to nurture, but to dominate."

The librarian pulls out a large, dusty tome from a nearby shelf and places it on the table. She opens it to a page filled with ancient depictions of gods and monsters.

Librarian:
"Ithlcarin, Amascut’s rival, was a protector of a once-great city now lost to the sands of the Kharidian Desert. Amascut coveted power above all else, and she found it in a most dangerous way—by consuming the souls of powerful beings. Her ultimate goal was to consume the soul of Ithlcarin's high priest, believing it would grant her dominion over the beasts of the upper planes."

(She pauses, letting the weight of her words sink in, before continuing in a hushed tone.)

Librarian:
"Legend tells that Amascut's hunger for power led her to touch the Stone of Jas, an artifact of unimaginable power, said to be the source of all life and magic. It is believed that shards of this stone, scattered across the planes, still hold enough power to bend the very fabric of reality. Perhaps it is for this reason that Amascut's tomb, if it still exists, is rumored to hold such a shard."

The PC's Insight: The librarian looks at the PC with a knowing smile.

Librarian:
"Of course, this isn't the first time you've come across such lore, is it? I've seen you here before, delving into the ancient histories, the forgotten myths. Not many share your interest in these esoteric subjects. Perhaps it's more than just curiosity that drives you—perhaps a connection to something greater, or someone who once pursued these same secrets?"

She gives the PC a moment to respond, acknowledging that this interest might stem from a personal quest, a mentor’s influence, or a deep-seated need to uncover forgotten truths.

Ultimately, she will suggest he head to the University in Slygarten, as it's on the way to the Kharidian desert that lay to the south if Yugi seeks exploration. There he can work along students for an exposition or seek out more expansive knowledge in their library.
