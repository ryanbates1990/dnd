Tempus’s Rebuke:

"Oh yeah, Bief! The mighty Tempus, the god of war, is here, and let me tell you something, brother—you’ve got a problem! Yeah, you knew Rose was trapped in that place, just waiting for a real warrior to come save her, but what did you do? You ran, yeah, you ran from a puny little skeleton mage! Not good, Bief, not good at all!"

"You still had backup, yeah! Jean and Locke, they were there, ready to fight by your side, but you? You hightailed it outta there like you were running from a hurricane! Not the kind of behavior Tempus expects from his chosen champion, oh no!"

"I picked you, Bief, I picked you to lead your people back to their ancestral homeland, yeah! But how can I trust a man who shows his back to the enemy? How, brother, how?! And what about Rose, huh? How can she trust you after that little disappearing act? She can’t, and that’s the truth!"

"If it wasn’t for me, yeah, me stepping in at the last second, Rose would still be down there, suffering, being used and abused by those fiends! You dropped the ball, Bief, you dropped it hard! Now you gotta pick it up, oh yeah, you gotta pick it up and prove to me, to Rose, and to everyone else that you’re not a coward, that you’re the warrior I know you can be!"

"So here’s the deal, Bief: you better step up, yeah, you better rise to the challenge, or you’re gonna find yourself out of the ring, brother, out of the fight for good! The Macho Man—Tempus—has spoken! Oh yeah!"

# The Chamber of Sacrifice

Bief finds himself standing in the center of a grand, circular chamber that exudes an ancient, ominous power. The walls are adorned with intricate hieroglyphics and carvings that depict scenes of battle, sacrifice, and the favor of the gods. The air is thick with the scent of incense and dust, reminiscent of long-forgotten tombs deep within the desert sands.
