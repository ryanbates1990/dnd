Need a table for whale memories

Sample Memory Visions:

Creation of Planes: The players witness the whale creating a new plane of existence, its massive form shaping matter and energy into worlds. They might see the birth of a civilization, only for the memory to shift and show the corruption that followed, symbolizing the whale's despair at mortal life’s decline.

War of the Gods: A memory might show the whale in battle alongside gods or cosmic beings, witnessing epic clashes that shaped the multiverse. These memories could hint at forgotten lore or even potential allies the players could seek out.

The Whale’s Oath of Silence: The whale remembers its decision to stop creating, perhaps after a catastrophic event or the betrayal of a trusted ally. This memory could be key to understanding the whale’s hesitancy to act now.

Lost Civilization: a futuristic society far beyond that which currently inhabits the material plane is seen destroying itself with atomic weaponry. This hints at a southern continent with lost civilizations

5. Interactive Dungeon Elements
To keep the players engaged, here are some interactive dungeon elements that align with the narrative:

Fungal Spores: Spore clouds spread through the air, causing hallucinations or madness in players. They may experience distorted versions of the whale’s memories or visions of fungal realities.

Astral Tools: The players could discover ancient tools or artifacts created by the whale during its early days. These could grant temporary control over parts of the whale’s body, allowing them to manipulate organs or nerves to progress.

Memory Puzzles: To access certain areas or cleanse parts of the whale’s body, the players must solve puzzles based on its memories. This could involve aligning crystalline memory shards or reconstructing visions of past events to unlock doors or disable fungal defenses.

## Destroying the Myconids

- fire
- defeating the 'brain' (they lose cognitive cohesion across the network). Myconid Overmind
- cut the myconids off from accessing parts of the whale

The Myconids offer the players dominion over a new plane of their design


# Potential Rewards
- Yugi learns the daylight spell + told a shard of Jas resides in
- Beif - background of the Ravenqueen - talk about the ritual that broke the ravenqueen, and that those mages reside in the bubble. Additionally, a promise to break the bubble if they can cleanse the land
- Castor - telling him that Lolth's influence over the land is the same influence that befell your friend Charles. The old gods will turn a blind eye to any vengeance reaped. Plus, grants immunity to spells that effect his memory
