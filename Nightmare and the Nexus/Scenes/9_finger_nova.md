# Setting

> You smell the scent of spiced incense and muffled laughter that welcomes you as you decend a narrow staircase into a dimly lit basement bar, The Silver Sylph. you hear hum of soft conversation and the occasionaly clink of glasses.
- The bar is lit with glowing amythest, giving it a purplish hue that reflects gently off of silver tablecloths and curtains.
- A corner stage hosts a lone bard, strumming an unusually haunting melody
- There is a large oval, ornate mirror behind the bar
    - `GM Note: ` if a player looks in the mirror they can see faint etchings or writings, but can't get close enough behind the bar to make anything out. If they touch the mirror a soft glow follows their fingers and is burned into the mirror. Their etching is the most prominent etching in the mirror.
        - If the players know thieves cant, they are able to see that most of these are status reports of the gang's dealings
- the bartender is an aging teifling with a well-groomed moustache that wipes a glass with a cloth that gives you guys a slight side-eye

`GM Note`: the clientel is roguish, scholars, and there even a few city guards.

Details:

**Safe Territory**: The Silver Sylph is known to be a neutral ground. **Violence is strictly forbidden**, and even long-standing rivalries are set aside within its walls.

**Coded Conversations (thieves cant):** Patrons engage in seemingly innocent small talk, but astute listeners might catch hints of coded language, discussing deals and transactions without explicitly stating them.

**Hidden Backrooms:** A discreet door at the back of the bar leads to private chambers where more sensitive discussions can take place.

# Enter Nova

> As you scan the room a very tall woman, maybe 6 feet with an athletic frame and piercing blue eyes, approaches you. She has raven-black hair pulled back into a tight bun, revealing a network of intricate tattoos that snake up her neck. She is dressed with a mix of elegance and practicality, a black leath jacket with silver-threaded trim.

`GM Note:` she has 10 fingers, but it is a moniker that persists from a time when a notorious gambler lost a finger to her in a high stakes game.

She says, "Well well, if it isn't the sick little boy I know so well. I thought you'd be dead by now Callahan."

`GM Note:` if the conversation gets too sensitve she asks for the players to join her in a back room with a **Silver Sylph cocktail** that allows the players to communicate telepathically for a short time.

## What she knows

- Nova has heard about a gang that has been spotted importing large amounts of cadaceous leaves, but doesn't know why.
- She knows that the cadaceous leaf is often used to create charms... but doesn't know why this would be of concern to a gang
- Does not know where the gang's hideout is or what their purpose is
- One of her employees reported that they are buying the herbs legitimately from a firbolg east of the city
