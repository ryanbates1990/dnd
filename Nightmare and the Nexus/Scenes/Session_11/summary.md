# Summary
- The group, initially distrusting Teddy, formerly known as Mayor Theodore Blackburne, reluctantly agreed to board a spacecraft that launched themselves into the astral sea.
- Yugi sought to read some technical manuals while the others patiently awaited their arrival within Kellemvor's quarantine.
- A huge, whale like creature emerged out of hyperspace next to the ship, and spoke telepathically to Bief.
- The whale let him know that it has a parasite and is recruiting the party to help rid the infestation. The whale encouraged Bief that he was aware of his plight and would break the bubble if he was able to calm the undead infestation.
- The party was swallowed and emerged from their vessel in the whale's belly.
- Traversing the inside of the whale the party learned that it was of strange origin and has the ability to create planes given its gifted fire of creation. The party met it's person who sensed it was endanger of being accessed by the parasitic fungal overmind.
- Additionally the party uncovered some of the whale's lost memories, learning that it abstains now from creating planes because he feels responsible for corrupted.
- Knowing that the spore's influence took root in the mind, you can sense that the whale is desperate to maintain control of its mind and body.

Remind the party of the room with the following description
> The floor and ceiling are covered in cilia, like a plain with tall grass, with 4 huge, cilia covered columns stretching from floor to ceiling. It looks like there once were many columns but have since whithered away, leaving a small mound of decay. The left and right walls are entirely gone, looking at the ceiling is like looking into the night sky with only thin, shimmering veil separating you from the chamber you are in and falling into the void. Periodically a large rush of wind hurls space dust from one side of the room to the other and you can see the cilia grabbing at debris from the air around it.

> At the far end of the room, A giant, fungal abomination working its tendrils violently against a radiant seal, preventing it from moving beyond the whale's astral lungs. It is tethered with what looks like an abhorrent umbilical cord to the ceiling of the organic chamber.

- The Fungal abomination spoke to you within your minds with a spectral tentacle. He seeks to create a homeworld for his warlord Rhaexorog to enslave all goo, and he beckons you to allow him access to the seal that shuts the fire of creation.
- Yugi has the key
- what do you do?
