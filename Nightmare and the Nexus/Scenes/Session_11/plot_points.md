- If the party falls unconscious, the whale's cilia will protect them, passing them out through the gills into the astral sea. The whale will communicate it's pleasure that they tried, and it will transport them to wear they need to be. The whale will speak sorrowfully that its flame will be extinguished and it will float endlessly and eternally.
`GM Note:` if this were to happen, the fungal overlords will create a world to enslave goo and seek to conquer other realms.

- The party will land in a swamp like landscape within the bubble via the whale's escort or their ship, either or.
