- If the party falls unconscious, the whale's cilia will protect them, passing them out through the gills into the astral sea. The whale will communicate it's pleasure that they tried, and it will transport them to wear they need to be. The whale will speak sorrowfully that its flame will be extinguished and it will float endlessly and eternally.
`GM Note:` if this were to happen, the fungal overlords will create a world to enslave goo and seek to conquer other realms.

- The party will land in a swamp like landscape within the bubble via the whale's escort or their ship, either or.

- Level up the players when they reach the bubble

## Bubble Flow
1. **Land in the Marsh (do Marsh Encounter)**
2. **Ghostly Havrani Riders**
    - appearing as they did as they died (wounded, clawed), appear out of the swamp, riding - lock eyes with Beif, and gesture through a path through the haunted woods. They are far ahead but they are clearly leading you.
    - **WHILE** they follow the riders, they can witness the following scenic encounters
        - marching undead
        - clouds of bats and mist moving through trees
3. **Havrani Resistance Outpost**
    - what is their way of live? How do they survive?
        - geurilla warfare
        - hiding in camouflaged canopies, signalling with sounds of birds
        - some underground encampments, occasional cave
        - praying to 'something' for rescue
            - `GM Note` their current religious practices should be morally sketchy, signalling their despare.
        - struggle with madness and paranoia.
    - what do they know? lore drops
        - They know about encampments of many Havrani and their descendents that are being farmed for their blood. They work to build fortresses and barracks and tithe with their blood. The vampiric overlords are preparing for when they can finally be released.
        - The vampires host extravagent events within their castle walls and believe they are subservient to a force atop the tower. They believe the vampires don't truly have free wills and are moved by some evil magic.
    - any items of protection they can offer?
        - camoflauge that provides +10 to stealth roles in the forest
