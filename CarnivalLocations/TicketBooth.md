# Ticket Booth

> A silver statue of a dancing faerie is mounted on the roof of this ticket booth and surrounded by fluttering butterflies. The booth is decorated with an animated depiction of the night sky, with shooting stars arcing across it.

> An elderly goblin perches behind the ticket counter, peering at you quizzically through a spyglass. He lowers the spyglass and calls out to you: "Greetings, fair fairgoers!"

- Nikolas Midnight, old wrinkled goblin
- Under the ticket counter is an ornate wooden box with a silver clasp and the monogram N.M. It contains one prepaid ticket for each visiting character. 
- tickets were purchased by Ellywick Tumblestrum, but Tumblestrum has asked Nikolas not to divulge this information. Instead, Nikolas claims that these tickets were paid for by "an anonymous benefactor.
- Nikolas explains that each ticket is good for eight attractions; characters who want to sample more of the carnival's offerings must buy another ticket. Most attractions in the carnival have a cost of 1 ticket punch. After the eighth punch, a ticket becomes a worthless keepsake.
- Any visitor who can't afford the price of a ticket or who doesn't want to pay for a ticket can make a fey pact with Nikolas instead

## Nikolas Midnight
- carries a spyglass and an ear horn, which he uses when talking to patrons
- Nikolas plays on the fact that he is old when using these items, but it's all a ruse; he is as sharp as a thorn, and his instruments allow him to get the true measure of guests. In his hands, the spyglass and ear horn grant Nikolas advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern lies and determine true intent. Characters who attempt to deceive Nikolas must succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the goblin's Wisdom (Insight) check.
- If one or more characters seem intent on disrupting the carnival, Nikolas scribbles a brief note to that effect and hands it to an invisible pixie that lurks under the ticket counter. The pixie delivers Nikolas's message to Mister Witch, who informs the carnival staff to keep a close eye on the group, and the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step
