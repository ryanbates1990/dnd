# Bubble-Pop Teapot
> A twenty-foot-tall teapot rests on a wooden platform, its painted surface whirling with moving imagery of flying dragons breathing streams of bubbles. A door at the base of the teapot allows entry to its interior; those who enter emerge from the spout enclosed in a bubble that detaches to float off across the carnival. Seven goblins sits around the platform, sipping tea from mismatched porcelain cups.

- 1 ticket punch

- The ride is managed by a friendly goblin noncombatant named Treaclewise (chaotic good), who wears bright yellow butterfly wings and carries a string of teaspoons on his belt. Seven more friendly goblins sit and chatter around the giant teapot while sipping tea. When the characters approach, Treaclewise gestures to a sign on his table that reads:

> The word that you intend to say, Try saying it a different way.

- If a character engages with Treaclewise in rhyming slang, he chuckles and gifts the character with a pouch of Scatterleaf Tea.

# Treasure
- Scatterleaf Tea. As an action, a creature can scatter these tea leaves on the ground in a 5-foot-radius circle, duplicating the effect of a protection from evil and good spell that lasts for 10 minutes. To gain the spell's protection, a creature must stand in the circle of tea leaves. In addition, a cup of hot, delicious tea magically appears in the protected creature's hands. A pouch contains enough leaves for one use.

Any Large or smaller creature that enters the teapot is enveloped in a magic bubble that floats up through the teapot's spout and into the sky, granting its occupant wonderful aerial views of the carnival. When the bubble pops after 1 minute, the passenger floats gently to the ground. Each bubble can hold only one creature (the smaller the creature, the smaller its bubble), plus whatever the creature is wearing or carrying.

A character suspended in the bubble can make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, gaining control of the bubble on a success. The character can then steer the bubble and pop it over any location on the carnival map. On a failed check, the character has no control over their bubble, and it pops over a random location. If a character tries to steer a bubble out of the carnival, it pops at the perimeter.

## They could potentially see a coven creature stealing when they're in the bubble.
