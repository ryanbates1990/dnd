# Feasting Orchard
> Music and mirth radiate from this park. The heady scents of flowers, mead, and berry pie waft through the air. Stilt-walkers pluck fruit from trees; musicians drum, pipe, and strum; and everywhere there is singing, dancing, and an inordinate amount of custard.
- The Feasting Orchard bustles all through the night with the activity of storytellers, musicians, and acrobats. The feasting tables are lined with merrymakers, and dances spring up at the drop of a hat.

- The contest table is piled high with small, glazed cupcakes, each filled with a dollop of berry custard.
- Give the players a way to enter the contest
- If they do there's a fat kid named Huey there that talks smack

- A contestant can swallow a cupcake in about 3 seconds and safely eat as many cupcakes as 3 + its Constitution modifier
- for each additional cake eaten, the contestant must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 custard damage
- Any contestant reduced to 0 hit points by custard damage is unable to continue, loses the contest, and has custard splattered all over them

## Treasure
The prize for winning the contest is a cupcake that functions like a potion of invisibility. The whole cupcake must be eaten to gain its benefit.
