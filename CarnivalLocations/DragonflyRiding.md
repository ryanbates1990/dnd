# Dragonfly Riding
> Huge lily pads rest on the surface of a pool glistening with phosphorescent algae. Giant dragonflies use the lily pads as landing platforms, buzzing loudly overhead with wings as brilliant as stained-glass windows, and alighting briefly to drop off and pick up excited passengers.

> Near the entrance, a small, smiling tree turns your way and beckons you over. A red squirrel clings to its leafy canopy, peering at you suspiciously.
- 1 ticket punch
- Northwind and Red are here
- A character who tries to steer their dragonfly off course must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to do so.


- As the characters' first ride begins, shouts of alarm erupt from a nearby lily pad. A giant dragonfly has just taken off prematurely with a patron on its back: a middle-aged dwarf with a bright blue beard sits unfastened in his harness.
- Kettlesteam, a kenku warlock, used a speak with animals spell to panic the dragonfly. 
- Characters can spot Kettlesteam before she slips away with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the kenku's Charisma (Deception) check

## What northwind knows
- Northwind doesn't know about the Hourglass Coven or what has become of Prismeer or its archfey ruler; it thinks the domain is still thriving under Zybilna's rule.

-  "I'm not really supposed to talk about this, but..."
- "Mister Witch and Mister Light aren't the carnival's original owners, y'know. They're not even from the Feywild! But it matters not an inch! We're all one big, happy family here!"
- "The carnival can't run without Mister Witch's pocket watch—I hope he never loses it!"
- "There's nothing Mister Light likes more than a sea of smiling faces—if the carnival's happy, he's happy!"
