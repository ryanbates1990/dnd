# The Kingdom
> The Pixie Kingdom is a tranquil oasis compared to the rest of the bustling carnival. The air is filled with the aroma of blackberry wine and flower blossoms. Eight brightly painted doorways are nestled in the bark at the bases of the surrounding trees.

- Optional Event, a kid drops ice cream into the kingdom and the hamster stops spinning the wheel to eat the ice cream. A rat comes to fight the hamster and get the ice cream. Pixies scream and beg for help

## Things to do in the Kingdom

## Hiding spots
Biscuit's Wheel. This wooden wheel has eight wicker carriages. Biscuit, the hamster who trundles around inside the contraption that turns the wheel, is very talkative. Offering food to the hamster is one way to keep him quiet.

Flower Bed. This area is home to several talking wildflowers. They're rather conceited and bicker over which of them has the silkiest petals and the finest aroma. Flattery can silence their bickering.

Heron's Nest. An awakened heron named Beatrice, who enjoys talking about the weather, roosts in a clump of long grasses and might allow characters to hide in her nest if they ask nicely.
