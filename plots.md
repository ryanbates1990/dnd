    - last mentioned, her 'crew' does not know the nature of this drug.
- Mentioned that she should be the mayor. She seemed somewhat interested
- She has scouted the mayor and discovered that there are falsified documents of him working briefly in a diamond mine northeast of town, no further reaching record of him, which is unusual for a person of wealth. Additionally, she knows that he has a shadow quartz, a token given in secret by Adolphus Rockwell, which symbolizes fealty to Adolphus, who's power and influence is far reaching via his monopolization of jewels and precious materials. Gifts of this nature are traditionally kept in his council room.

## Rael
- He wants a piece of Amber. It was his girlfriends favorite gemstone because it came from the trees and can preserve history in the rock. It would remind him of his youth. Amber can be found deep within the diamond mine northeast of the city. The mine has long been forgotten by the populace, but is being used by dragonkin and their slaves to search for diamonds. The mine also contains deep within it, a portal to the shadowfell.

### Unknowns
-I like making this adolphus's half brother. Adolphus's vanity would disallow any acknowledgment that his half-brother is more powerful in anyway

### Ideas on story incorporation
- Rex is haunted by the dragon in his dreams, specifically the eyes.
- People scoff at his last name, people could believe that he hasn't earned his name, as Elandor is heroic in his accomplishments. Akin to someone referring to themselves as Hercules.
