# Situation Ideas

1. A Wagon carrying precious materials is being imported and robbers are set to ambush. The boxes carrying the goods have false bottoms.
1. A couple of brauny farmers enter a bar and cause a ruckus, accusing people of stealing their livestock by way of 'fancy magic'. In reality, a portal to the astral plane randomly woke up and a cow walked in and the rift closed. Clues could include a precious gem/stone (can check which firm got a shipment of this material in) found near the scene of the incident, a set of footprints the follow to a nearby road (so you know it isn't the farmers, and the footprints could be identifiable to a particular shoemaker, the shoemaker might know who might have mentioned carrying in an important shipment)
1. One of the farmers could be killed following inquiring about the events and his father could come to town pleaing for help from the party.
1. The plants that are grown in the university that act as a fuel source are caught fire!! This could be from Blackburne trying to threaten one of the deans not making good on his end of a deal (a bribery).
1. One of the Van Green family members is found dead.
1. If the players have been around several of these 'events' Silas comes and slips them a note to a hideout but warns the players that they're being watched (and as they look around, they catch a glimpse of a woman in a black coat, that being Seraphina Darkspire)
1. One of the University lights goes off nearby - if the players investigate, they see a girl being dragged away by a group of muscular dudes. In a nearby household they hear muffled shouts and clangs. This is an assassination gone awry. 
1. Group of jocks from the local university that think the party is trying to steal the ‘leader’s’ girl. The party could rescue the girl from a near danger. Like a wagon incoming or getting out of the way of a bar fight.

# In the lab

1. A Githyanki creature disrobed and sitting in an uncomfortable chair being interrogated by men in white coats and you can see one put out a smoke on the skin of the Gith.
1. A large amount of precious gems and metals being put into crates with false bottoms and filled with innocuous materials and being loaded into carts.
1. Ships being worked on/welded
1. Notes dealing with how to travel through the astal plane.
1. Pictures of graphs detailing different planes (populated with '?' as well)
1. Construct door passes

### Toolkit

1. High Inquisitor Seraphina Darkspire
1. City guards (He can use these to 'imprison' the players on trumped up charges and delay any sort of investigation they're doing.)
1. A Goon Squad
1. Former Employer (Silas) to feed information to the players.

### Factions in the City
- Astral Nexus Scientists/Geologists
    - Want to discover means of planar travel. They have had recent success traveling through planes and are realizing that the great wheel theory may not best represent cosmology as it truly exists. They have discovered a repeatable connection to another plane where they have found a vein of incredibly rare gems that are rich in arcanic power. However, they are angering locals who plan to seek vengeance by taking what values most from the people that robbed them. They are trying to secretly sell their gems to (Needs name, gem owner) to keep prices high and not let the abundance of their resource be known
    - The plane they have reached is Arborea, specifically, Arvandor, the lowest plane in Arborea. The Mayor, being a devout follower of the Ravenqueen, has intimate knowledge of Arvandor allowing them to find a highway. The section of Arvandor they have found is inhabited largely by cyclops and giants.
    - They have figured out how to create a tear in the astral plane similar to a gate spell through scientific means
- Adolphus Rockwell
- Van Green Family (Suspicious of Mayor Blackburne - wants to smear him)
    - this is where we can use Mayor Blackburne's sudden appearance and claim to fame against him
- Silas and the gang
    - Think something is funny going on with the astral nexus. Former colleagues haven't been seen in months, they want to the bottom of it.
- druids outside of the city that get upset with the pollution from the factory?

# Next Session TODOs
- Bief's encounter with Tempus.
    - It seems like an ordinary rebuke, but it *seems* like the interaction is complete yet unbenkownst to Bief, the vision continues with Tempus leading him to the Havrani encampment, but the encampment seems like the old homeland... like they found a place to truly be.
- **Test of Courage** The Havrani's splendor is restored and peace is among them. Most of the men are out enjoying a hunt. The time is dusk and as the sun goes to sleep, some people come out to enjoy the nightlife. Things appear normal but as the sun finally sets, vampires attack and murder civilians right and left. People flee and encourage bief to leave, lest he be turned, and to live to fight another day when he has help from others being back from the hunt.
- **Test of Leadership** Chamber of sacrifice. Need some sort of goal, like offering enough blood to a bowl to release some sort of magical forcefield.
    - periodically being attacked by something is good... but it would be nice if there were 3 distinct roles that could be performed.

    - in the 4 quadrants of the room there are
        - door that is closed by a shimmering, transparent magical barreir that leads to great treasure
        - a bowl of sacrifice (enough blood here opens the door). Requires 30hp of blood to complete the ritual, 1d8 at a time
        - a bowl of healing (limited), can heal up to 60 hp, 2d8 at a time.
        - a crank on the side of the room that rotates a mirror in the center of the room. Players can spend a turn to crank the mirror a full 180 degrees. The light illuminates 25 percent of the room at any given time.

    - in each corner of the room is a guardian, if the guardian is exposed to light, it is encased in stone and cannot move, if left in darkness, they are awoken and seek to destroy the pc's. 

    - 4 guardians, 2 warriors that guard the bowls. A ranger and a mager on the opposite side.
    - the archer can shoot an arrow that encases a 5 foot area in darkness that lasts for 2 turns.
    - mager's bolt sends dark energy and reduces maximum hitpoints.
    - the mager can *share* or siphon 2d8 damage from another guardian that is currently in darkness.
    
    all the while there is an exit that anyone can take at any point. The exit 
- **Vision** of the PC's, and where the PC's are, or where to meet them.

# Castor introduction

`GM Note` The amulet of lost dreams is in possesion of the Mayor who seeks to return it to the raven queen herself. The mayor used the amulet to relieve adversaries of their memories, thus, not much is known of his rise to power.

Castor receives a mission to disrupt a caravan (`GM Note: ` carrying precious metals known to exist in the astral plane) and leave no survivors. It is imperative this is done in secret

(This should unlock the labratory dungeon and this is where we should reveal that the mayor both has the amulet and has the means to travel through the astral plane)

# Yugi introduction

In the slygarten university Yugi is confronted with a librarian who is frustrated with him for lingering too long in a restricted section which is closing soon. (Most of the library is open 24 hours). He then inquires about what he is actually looking for and sees if he can help him push him in the right direction.

If luke complies, he is provided a book that contains the location of an exodia artifact, one that lies in the beast planes.

He then proceeds to sleep in a chair in the university
