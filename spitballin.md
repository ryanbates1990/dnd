would like for the players to ultimately discover the lab and uncover things happening in the lab.

# Situation Ideas

1. A Wagon carrying precious materials is being imported and robbers are set to ambush. The boxes carrying the goods have false bottoms.
1. A couple of brauny farmers enter a bar and cause a ruckus, accusing people of stealing their livestock by way of 'fancy magic'. In reality, a portal to the astral plane randomly woke up and a cow walked in and the rift closed. Clues could include a precious gem/stone (can check which firm got a shipment of this material in) found near the scene of the incident, a set of footprints the follow to a nearby road (so you know it isn't the farmers, and the footprints could be identifiable to a particular shoemaker, the shoemaker might know who might have mentioned carrying in an important shipment)
1. One of the farmers could be killed following inquiring about the events and his father could come to town pleaing for help from the party.
1. The plants that are grown in the university that act as a fuel source are caught fire!! This could be from Blackburne trying to threaten one of the deans not making good on his end of a deal (a bribery).
1. One of the Van Green family members is found dead.
1. If the players have been around several of these 'events' Silas comes and slips them a note to a hideout but warns the players that they're being watched (and as they look around, they catch a glimpse of a woman in a black coat, that being Seraphina Darkspire)
1. This hideout can have people that know the whereabouts of the laboratory and have seen people going in and out of it, as well as hearing of recent disappearances of former employees.
1. One of the University lights goes off nearby - if the players investigate, they see a girl being dragged away by a group of muscular dudes. In a nearby household they hear muffled shouts and clangs. This is an assassination gone awry. 
1. Constructs outside of the laboratory

# In the lab

1. A Githyanki creature disrobed and sitting in an uncomfortable chair being interrogated by men in white coats and you can see one put out a smoke on the skin of the Gith.
1. A large amount of precious gems and metals being put into crates with false bottoms and filled with innocuous materials and being loaded into carts.

# Villains

## Mayor Theodore Blackburne 

He came to power by persuading (financially) a vote to elect from several university memberes who sit on the board of the city. This bribery is kept secret. The Van Green family has suspected this and is desperate to uncover this fact and bring it to light.

has started searching exports for particular outgoing metals that bond properly with a newly discovered metal from the astral plane. This was discovered within the Astral Nexus Laboratory, a laboratory specializing in planar discovery. Mayor Blackburne cut all funding for the project when he took office 2 years ago, however, unbeknownst to the public, he continued operation privately after finding out they discovered a convenient way to enter the astral plane.

His goal of course, is to amass incredible sums of money for his own satisfaction. To do this, his lab needs to be secret, he needs a buyer for resources he uncovers (and for buyers to understand their value), and he needs security.

### Toolkit

1. High Inquisitor Seraphina Darkspire
1. City guards (He can use these to 'imprison' the players on trumped up charges and delay any sort of investigation they're doing.)
1. A Goon Squad
1. Former Employer (Silas) to feed information to the players.
