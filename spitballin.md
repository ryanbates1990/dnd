would like for the players to ultimately discover the lab and uncover things happening in the lab.

# Situation Ideas

1. A Wagon carrying precious materials is being imported and robbers are set to ambush. The boxes carrying the goods have false bottoms.
1. A couple of brauny farmers enter a bar and cause a ruckus, accusing people of stealing their livestock by way of 'fancy magic'. In reality, a portal to the astral plane randomly woke up and a cow walked in and the rift closed. Clues could include a precious gem/stone (can check which firm got a shipment of this material in) found near the scene of the incident, a set of footprints the follow to a nearby road (so you know it isn't the farmers, and the footprints could be identifiable to a particular shoemaker, the shoemaker might know who might have mentioned carrying in an important shipment)
1. One of the farmers could be killed following inquiring about the events and his father could come to town pleaing for help from the party.
1. The plants that are grown in the university that act as a fuel source are caught fire!! This could be from Blackburne trying to threaten one of the deans not making good on his end of a deal (a bribery).
1. One of the Van Green family members is found dead.
1. If the players have been around several of these 'events' Silas comes and slips them a note to a hideout but warns the players that they're being watched (and as they look around, they catch a glimpse of a woman in a black coat, that being Seraphina Darkspire)
1. This hideout can have people that know the whereabouts of the laboratory and have seen people going in and out of it, as well as hearing of recent disappearances of former employees.
1. One of the University lights goes off nearby - if the players investigate, they see a girl being dragged away by a group of muscular dudes. In a nearby household they hear muffled shouts and clangs. This is an assassination gone awry. 
1. Constructs outside of the laboratory
1. Group of jocks from the local university that think the party is trying to steal the ‘leader’s’ girl. The party could rescue the girl from a near danger. Like a wagon incoming or getting out of the way of a bar fight.

# In the lab

1. A Githyanki creature disrobed and sitting in an uncomfortable chair being interrogated by men in white coats and you can see one put out a smoke on the skin of the Gith.
1. A large amount of precious gems and metals being put into crates with false bottoms and filled with innocuous materials and being loaded into carts.

### Toolkit

1. High Inquisitor Seraphina Darkspire
1. City guards (He can use these to 'imprison' the players on trumped up charges and delay any sort of investigation they're doing.)
1. A Goon Squad
1. Former Employer (Silas) to feed information to the players.

### City Districts:
- University
- Science District
- Noble Housing
- Entertainment District
- Poor Area
- Warehouse and Metallurgy District (blue collar work)
- Merchant District

### Potential Adventure Sites
- Astral Nexus lab
- Sewer system?

### Factions in the City
- Astral Nexus Scientists/Geologists
    - Want to discover means of planar travel. They have had recent success traveling through planes and are realizing that the great wheel theory may not best represent cosmology as it truly exists. They have discovered a repeatable connection to another plane where they have found a vein of incredibly rare gems that are rich in arcanic power. However, they are angering locals who plan to seek vengeance by taking what values most from the people that robbed them. They are trying to secretly sell their gems to (Needs name, gem owner) to keep prices high and not let the abundance of their resource be known
    - The plane they have reached is Arborea, specifically, Arvandor, the lowest plane in Arborea. The Mayor, being a devout follower of the Ravenqueen, has intimate knowledge of Arvandor allowing them to find a highway. The section of Arvandor they have found is inhabited largely by cyclops and giants.
    - They have figured out how to create a tear in the astral plane similar to a gate spell through scientific means
- Cultists of the Raven Queen
    - Mayor Blackburne being a shadar-kai leader of this cult, wants to find a way to free his lover in a quarantined pocket of undead nearby. Her lover, being a servant of the raven queen, was in battle to destroy the undead that inhabited the area. He believes she is still alive and in danger. Unbeknownst to him, she is petrified and being used as bait by a Nagpa in wait, determined to eradicate any followers of the Ravenqueen.
- Adolphus Rockwell
    - Jeweler, supplying diamonds to Mayor Blackburne in favor of law enforcement to turn a blind eye to his dealings. Mayor Blackburne is using the diamonds to supply to the Astral Nexus Scientists for portal research so he can reach the quarantine to save his lover. Adolphus is using his mob to run a human trafficking ring. The trade attracts the most wealth and desperate individuals.
    - A polymorphed adult blue dragon with his lair locked away in a system of crystallized tunnels north of the city.
        - within this lair, is a system of tunnels that looked like they have been blocked but out of one tunnel remains the skeleton of a 120 foot long creature, a defeated purple worm.
        - air elementals, storm elementals, and kobold minions all inhabit the dragons lair.
- Van Green Family (Suspicious of Mayor Blackburne - wants to smear him)
    - this is where we can use Mayor Blackburne's sudden appearance and claim to fame against him
- (Needs Name) and his gang
    - Owner of a prestigious gem shop, additionally owns a metal working plant in the poorer parts of the city, runs a ring of robbers/pillagers/slavery, to keep his material costs high, despite the regularity of the metals he uses.
    - They want to tighten their grip on resource supply and smear the reputation of other precious metal and gem workers.
        - Idea for situation, college kid wants to buy an engagement ring but its outrageously expensive
- Silas and the gang
    - Think something is funny going on with the astral nexus. Former colleagues haven't been seen in months, they want to the bottom of it.
- druids outside of the city that get upset with the pollution from the factory?

# Next Steps
- itemizing a couple services
    - Need 'task table' for merchants guild
    - Need 'Rumor table' for bars
    - Need 'background event table' for flyers
    - Should come up with a list of magical items/ammo/clothing/potions/etc. stock the shops.
- Need Scenic Encounter Tables populated 
    - need these for each district as well.
- `Come up with encounters/clues for each faction and what that faction is trying to do.`
- come up with an adventure site for each faction??
    - maybe just harden the factions motives and what they are working towards.
- we need to come up with one off locations within the city for prison etc.

# Kicking Things off
1. Let players get footing in the city
1. Loose cart/cargo has false bottoms. Silas witnesses, tries to persuade characters to come to their safehouse unseen that evening.
    - need to prep Silas's safehouse
        - the gang provides an engineer that they helped build
            - The location of the entrance changes (finding an engineer will help them predict the location).
                - players can identify individuals who are employed, and follow
                - players can predict the location
        - the gang notes that a keycard is used to pass the constructs... but doens't know of a modern one
            - Clockwork Engineer (prep a small lab for this). 
                - `GM Note`: key cards are activated by reading a sequence that shows under laser light and that sequence needs programmed into a construct.
                - A constructs's mind is ran on a 'hum' from the small oscillations of a crystal. A constructs mind is synced with the hum of a master crystal. If the master crystal is found, he can read passcodes that he can create a recognizeable key on.
    - Silas wants to gather information on how to regain access to `Dreese Labs`
        - Adventure site that for sure needs prepped.
    - There are a couple engineers/contractors that hold different information that will help the characters reach farther into the laboratory.
    - the gang can be confronted by mobs/minions to interfere with their progress/bad things can happen to people that they talk to.
        - need a reason to do this though... maybe they are being tracked by someone using locate object on the stone they took from the cart in the beginning?

# Services

These locations should be keyed and detailed with basic actions and characters within

**Entertainment:**  
Entertainment District: gambling house, theater, house of illusions

**Shopping:**  

**Bars:**  
- a strip of bars between the university and clockwork districts
- and a strip of bars (more like clubs) in the entertainment district

**Religion**
- Church of the Raven Queen (Merchants District)
    - should this be a thing or is it more discrete. speaking through the ravens though potions of animal speak?
- Church of Lathander?

**Other**
- Observatory on a hill in the university district

# Questions that need answered
- How does Adolphus accomplish his human trade operation? We need to answer how his operation takes place so that we can drop clues to different parts of it. We want the clues to eventually lead to adolphus's home, which has a trap door that leads to the blue dragon's lair.

- What clues could lead to the discovery of the operation?
    - probably need to be a suspicious nobleman.
    - girls could have gone missing throughout the city.
        - clues could lead to a particular guard who was paid off and told to turn a blind eye

- How does Mayor Blackburne plan to leave the quarantine, is he trying to leave the portal open and bring undead to the material plane?
- What needs to happen for Mayor Blackburne to be able to open the portal to the quarantine. Point of the question is to have a longer 'trail' to the lab for the players to follow - or allow them to find the lab but they aren't effectively traveling across the astral plane. Mayor blackburne is looking for an artifact to be able to connect to the quarantine? Maybe he is looking for a link and needs to steal an artefact from the church.
    - How are the scientists detecting connections for planar travel?
    - Do they have a ship to navigate the astral sea?

# Things that are happening
- The universities Elemental Studies department is preparing to send a research team to investigate the ongoing thunderstorms to the north of Slygarten
    - They hope to come to answers as to how this storm has been able to persist and how they replicate that in a lab setting to utilize the electrical enegy.

- Adolphus Rockwell is running a human trafficking operation. His lackey's are using modify memory to establish the roots of stockholm syndrome and steal their prey.
