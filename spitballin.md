# Situation Ideas

1. A Wagon carrying precious materials is being imported and robbers are set to ambush. The boxes carrying the goods have false bottoms.
1. A couple of brauny farmers enter a bar and cause a ruckus, accusing people of stealing their livestock by way of 'fancy magic'. In reality, a portal to the astral plane randomly woke up and a cow walked in and the rift closed. Clues could include a precious gem/stone (can check which firm got a shipment of this material in) found near the scene of the incident, a set of footprints the follow to a nearby road (so you know it isn't the farmers, and the footprints could be identifiable to a particular shoemaker, the shoemaker might know who might have mentioned carrying in an important shipment)
1. One of the farmers could be killed following inquiring about the events and his father could come to town pleaing for help from the party.
1. The plants that are grown in the university that act as a fuel source are caught fire!! This could be from Blackburne trying to threaten one of the deans not making good on his end of a deal (a bribery).
1. One of the Van Green family members is found dead.
1. If the players have been around several of these 'events' Silas comes and slips them a note to a hideout but warns the players that they're being watched (and as they look around, they catch a glimpse of a woman in a black coat, that being Seraphina Darkspire)
1. One of the University lights goes off nearby - if the players investigate, they see a girl being dragged away by a group of muscular dudes. In a nearby household they hear muffled shouts and clangs. This is an assassination gone awry. 
1. Group of jocks from the local university that think the party is trying to steal the ‘leader’s’ girl. The party could rescue the girl from a near danger. Like a wagon incoming or getting out of the way of a bar fight.

# In the lab

1. A Githyanki creature disrobed and sitting in an uncomfortable chair being interrogated by men in white coats and you can see one put out a smoke on the skin of the Gith.
1. A large amount of precious gems and metals being put into crates with false bottoms and filled with innocuous materials and being loaded into carts.
1. Ships being worked on/welded
1. Notes dealing with how to travel through the astal plane.
1. Pictures of graphs detailing different planes (populated with '?' as well)
1. Construct door passes

## Ancestral Homeland ideas
- Because there is a dome, this would certainly affect the environment
    - thick mist, swampy, dark
    - must be a ghetto-fied water treatment plant for the humans being farmed for blood
    - undead work as soldiers/guards/laborers
    - humans are chained, bred, live miserable lives, have homes but it is a ghetto
    - tower of drakan
    - theater of blood
    - canifas
    - tower of the vulture mages
