# Situation Ideas

1. A Wagon carrying precious materials is being imported and robbers are set to ambush. The boxes carrying the goods have false bottoms.
1. A couple of brauny farmers enter a bar and cause a ruckus, accusing people of stealing their livestock by way of 'fancy magic'. In reality, a portal to the astral plane randomly woke up and a cow walked in and the rift closed. Clues could include a precious gem/stone (can check which firm got a shipment of this material in) found near the scene of the incident, a set of footprints the follow to a nearby road (so you know it isn't the farmers, and the footprints could be identifiable to a particular shoemaker, the shoemaker might know who might have mentioned carrying in an important shipment)
1. One of the farmers could be killed following inquiring about the events and his father could come to town pleaing for help from the party.
1. The plants that are grown in the university that act as a fuel source are caught fire!! This could be from Blackburne trying to threaten one of the deans not making good on his end of a deal (a bribery).
1. One of the Van Green family members is found dead.
1. If the players have been around several of these 'events' Silas comes and slips them a note to a hideout but warns the players that they're being watched (and as they look around, they catch a glimpse of a woman in a black coat, that being Seraphina Darkspire)
1. One of the University lights goes off nearby - if the players investigate, they see a girl being dragged away by a group of muscular dudes. In a nearby household they hear muffled shouts and clangs. This is an assassination gone awry. 
1. Group of jocks from the local university that think the party is trying to steal the ‘leader’s’ girl. The party could rescue the girl from a near danger. Like a wagon incoming or getting out of the way of a bar fight.

# In the lab

1. A Githyanki creature disrobed and sitting in an uncomfortable chair being interrogated by men in white coats and you can see one put out a smoke on the skin of the Gith.
1. A large amount of precious gems and metals being put into crates with false bottoms and filled with innocuous materials and being loaded into carts.
1. Ships being worked on/welded
1. Notes dealing with how to travel through the astal plane.
1. Pictures of graphs detailing different planes (populated with '?' as well)
1. Construct door passes

### Toolkit

1. High Inquisitor Seraphina Darkspire
1. City guards (He can use these to 'imprison' the players on trumped up charges and delay any sort of investigation they're doing.)
1. A Goon Squad
1. Former Employer (Silas) to feed information to the players.

### Factions in the City
- Astral Nexus Scientists/Geologists
    - Want to discover means of planar travel. They have had recent success traveling through planes and are realizing that the great wheel theory may not best represent cosmology as it truly exists. They have discovered a repeatable connection to another plane where they have found a vein of incredibly rare gems that are rich in arcanic power. However, they are angering locals who plan to seek vengeance by taking what values most from the people that robbed them. They are trying to secretly sell their gems to (Needs name, gem owner) to keep prices high and not let the abundance of their resource be known
    - The plane they have reached is Arborea, specifically, Arvandor, the lowest plane in Arborea. The Mayor, being a devout follower of the Ravenqueen, has intimate knowledge of Arvandor allowing them to find a highway. The section of Arvandor they have found is inhabited largely by cyclops and giants.
    - They have figured out how to create a tear in the astral plane similar to a gate spell through scientific means
- Cultists of the Raven Queen
    - Mayor Blackburne being a shadar-kai leader of this cult, wants to find a way to free his lover in a quarantined pocket of undead nearby. Her lover, being a servant of the raven queen, was in battle to destroy the undead that inhabited the area. He believes she is still alive and in danger. Unbeknownst to him, she is petrified and being used as bait by a Nagpa in wait, determined to eradicate any followers of the Ravenqueen.
- Adolphus Rockwell
    - Jeweler, supplying diamonds to Mayor Blackburne in favor of law enforcement to turn a blind eye to his dealings. Mayor Blackburne is using the diamonds to supply to the Astral Nexus Scientists for portal research so he can reach the quarantine to save his lover. Adolphus is using his mob to run a human trafficking ring. The trade attracts the most wealth and desperate individuals.
    - A polymorphed adult blue dragon with his lair locked away in a system of crystallized tunnels north of the city.
        - within this lair, is a system of tunnels that looked like they have been blocked but out of one tunnel remains the skeleton of a 120 foot long creature, a defeated purple worm.
        - air elementals, storm elementals, and kobold minions all inhabit the dragons lair.
- Van Green Family (Suspicious of Mayor Blackburne - wants to smear him)
    - this is where we can use Mayor Blackburne's sudden appearance and claim to fame against him
- (Needs Name) and his gang
    - Owner of a prestigious gem shop, additionally owns a metal working plant in the poorer parts of the city, runs a ring of robbers/pillagers/slavery, to keep his material costs high, despite the regularity of the metals he uses.
    - They want to tighten their grip on resource supply and smear the reputation of other precious metal and gem workers.
        - Idea for situation, college kid wants to buy an engagement ring but its outrageously expensive
- Silas and the gang
    - Think something is funny going on with the astral nexus. Former colleagues haven't been seen in months, they want to the bottom of it.
- druids outside of the city that get upset with the pollution from the factory?

- a strip of bars between the university and clockwork districts
- and a strip of bars (more like clubs) in the entertainment district

    - should this be a thing or is it more discrete. speaking through the ravens though potions of animal speak?
- Church of Lathander?

# Questions that need answered
- What cures Luke's disease?

# Events
- Mayor Blackburne
- Adolphus

# Immediate TODOs

## Rose Quest
- Brothel Basement dungeon
- Where exactly IS Rose - Is she in the basement of the brothel?

## 9 Finger Nova
- How can she actually exploit the Mayor?
- What does her operation look like exactly?
    - She could have investigated him herself and come up with the following information
        - not much is known about him before about 6 years ago.
        - Found Records of him working in one of adolphus Rockwell's diamond mine northeast of the city
        - Nothing has been found of the ravenqueen associations... yet.
    - Actuals:
        - He crossed to the material plane via a portal deep within the depths of the mine
        - He helped lead adolphus to the shadowfell to acquire 'smoke quartz', a jewel with magical properties that can be enhanced to dampen sound or create shrouds of darkness (and also possessing some intrinsic beauty)
        - He has taken refuge in the mobile 'astral nexus' which is made by the magnificent mansion spell

## Diamond Mine
- May need updating to include a portal to the shadowfell.

## RavenQueen Followers
- where do they actually meet?
    - the abandoned Astral Nexus laboratory
- who is there?
    - Mostly drow, The mayor and his cabinet, wealthy humans (mostly men) that likely are employed in planar studies engineering and research roles
- who knows about them?
- what is their purpose besides releasing the quarantine?
    - They are the ones that heard of a servant of lolth causing havoc in humble haven.
- We need stats for the Mayor and some of his cabinet (should have 3 minions)

## Laboratores
- We want to have specific creatures that guard the place (Ie, elemental lab might have elementals, mechanical may have automata, etc.)

## Other
- Need an explanation for the Kobolds!
    - They are just coming into town to party basically, and are able to find harder drugs on the edge of forgeheart/humble haven
    - They work as slave drivers in the diamond mine

## Max
Part of a tribe displaced by the undead immigration and he is championing the return and he needs help doing it.
- he's getting the Vampire Lord who is feeding off his tribes originally members and has force bread them to be used for blood sources.
- Maybe some of his current tribe is being used in Adolphus's Jewel mines.

### Spitballing for Max
- recognized as part of one of the displaced by a Kellemvor cleric who offers to show him that Kellemvor's actions were just.

## Rex (Raiden Skyreaper)
- childhood tragedy caused by a black dragon with red eyes that spewed lightning.
    - I like making this adolphus's half brother. Adolphus's vanity would disallow any acknowledgment that his half-brother is more powerful in anyway
- He was trained under a sellsword named Isolde Silverhawk.
- Rex is haunted by the dragon in his dreams, specifically the eyes.
- Got his name from a legendary beast slayer named Elandor Skyreaper
    - This could be a point of insult towards Rex, people could believe that he hasn't earned his name.

## Luke (Harken Callahan)
He is diseased (was cursed by some character) and needs to find a cure. Is suspicious that an illithid spawn could cure his disease. Him and his family were cursed after enterring an enchanted forest and made examples of after killing a sacred deer for food. It is currently unknown what will cure his disease

One Idea I have for him is that the energy that exists in his body is otherworldly and he would be drawn to another plane if they were to travel in the astral sea. This other plane being something like the beastlands and finding a sacred pool of cleansing or something like that. 

What is the disease? Maybe some magic that ordinarly hastens the process of decomposition/rot? ie, part of his flesh is dying though he is still alive.

He can also find a genie on the elemental plane if he so desires.
>Those who wished to gain the brief service of a djinn should gift them with fine meals, gemstones, magical items, flattery, and other forms of bribery.

## Other
- The universities Elemental Studies department is preparing to send a research team to investigate the ongoing thunderstorms to the north of Slygarten
    - They hope to come to answers as to how this storm has been able to persist and how they replicate that in a lab setting to utilize the electrical enegy.

- A shadow demon is feeding off of the fears of people at humble haven. The demon is a pet summoned by Rael, who feeds off of the fear harvested and offers a portion to Lolth. Rael lives in Humble Haven but has a trap door basement where him and his wife offer their Prayers.
