would like for the players to ultimately discover the lab and uncover things happening in the lab.

# Situation Ideas

1. A Wagon carrying precious materials is being imported and robbers are set to ambush. The boxes carrying the goods have false bottoms.
1. A couple of brauny farmers enter a bar and cause a ruckus, accusing people of stealing their livestock by way of 'fancy magic'. In reality, a portal to the astral plane randomly woke up and a cow walked in and the rift closed. Clues could include a precious gem/stone (can check which firm got a shipment of this material in) found near the scene of the incident, a set of footprints the follow to a nearby road (so you know it isn't the farmers, and the footprints could be identifiable to a particular shoemaker, the shoemaker might know who might have mentioned carrying in an important shipment)
1. One of the farmers could be killed following inquiring about the events and his father could come to town pleaing for help from the party.
1. The plants that are grown in the university that act as a fuel source are caught fire!! This could be from Blackburne trying to threaten one of the deans not making good on his end of a deal (a bribery).
1. One of the Van Green family members is found dead.
1. If the players have been around several of these 'events' Silas comes and slips them a note to a hideout but warns the players that they're being watched (and as they look around, they catch a glimpse of a woman in a black coat, that being Seraphina Darkspire)
1. This hideout can have people that know the whereabouts of the laboratory and have seen people going in and out of it, as well as hearing of recent disappearances of former employees.
1. One of the University lights goes off nearby - if the players investigate, they see a girl being dragged away by a group of muscular dudes. In a nearby household they hear muffled shouts and clangs. This is an assassination gone awry. 
1. Constructs outside of the laboratory
1. Group of jocks from the local university that think the party is trying to steal the ‘leader’s’ girl. The party could rescue the girl from a near danger. Like a wagon incoming or getting out of the way of a bar fight.

# In the lab

1. A Githyanki creature disrobed and sitting in an uncomfortable chair being interrogated by men in white coats and you can see one put out a smoke on the skin of the Gith.
1. A large amount of precious gems and metals being put into crates with false bottoms and filled with innocuous materials and being loaded into carts.

# Villains

## Mayor Theodore Blackburne 

He came to power by persuading (financially) a vote to elect from several university memberes who sit on the board of the city. This bribery is kept secret. The Van Green family has suspected this and is desperate to uncover this fact and bring it to light.

has started searching exports for particular outgoing metals that bond properly with a newly discovered metal from the astral plane. This was discovered within the Astral Nexus Laboratory, a laboratory specializing in planar discovery. Mayor Blackburne cut all funding for the project when he took office 2 years ago, however, unbeknownst to the public, he continued operation privately after finding out they discovered a convenient way to enter the astral plane.

His goal of course, is to amass incredible sums of money for his own satisfaction. To do this, his lab needs to be secret, he needs a buyer for resources he uncovers (and for buyers to understand their value), and he needs security.

(From slack, a separate note) Point of inspiration: The evil mayor could be after a means to teleport through the astral plane at will - It turns out he is a shardar-kai in disguise who’s lover is trapped in a ‘quarantined’ demi plane of undead. He means to create a breach in the astral plane and force his way in and release an artifact that is responsible for the planar tether.
- If investigating his home/office he could have a painted portrait of a royal drow lady stowed in a closet.
- His past is generally unknown
- Some of his followers worship the Raven Queen
- He is known in the town to be single
- Think the key is that we need to have reasons why he was persuasive as a ‘new’ political candidate
The undead tower could have several legendary artifacts working together. Wall of Force/antilife shell, etc. Or it could have Godly interference.

Would need to make a key dungeon for his home

Other ideas for beginning ‘villains’:


### Toolkit

1. High Inquisitor Seraphina Darkspire
1. City guards (He can use these to 'imprison' the players on trumped up charges and delay any sort of investigation they're doing.)
1. A Goon Squad
1. Former Employer (Silas) to feed information to the players.

### Religion Notes
- She was originally a much beloved elf queen from the Feywild. The Ravenqueen was originally ushering the elves to Arvandor (a divine realm), but some of her wizard follwers siphoned some of the ritual magic into themselves for their own gain. In retaliation the Ravenqueen pushed them severely with a burst of divine fury. This corrupted the ritual and dragged the queen and her followers into the Shadowfell where she was killed. But because of her divine powers arose and grew in madness and grief (probably obsessed with memories of her previous life). She then transformed the wizards into wretched avian forms known as nagpas and banished them forever. Her form dissolved into disconnected sensory perceptions and is now extremely mysterious because of that.
- It is Rumored that she led a campaign against a god of death who held dominion in Pluton, an a gloom plane in Hades

### City Districts:
- University
- Science District
- Noble Housing
- Entertainment District
- Poor Area
- Warehouse and Metallurgy District (blue collar work)
- Merchant District

### Potential Adventure Sites
- Astral Nexus lab
- Sewer system?

### Factions in the City
- Astral Nexus Scientists/Geologists
    - Want to discover means of planar travel. They have had recent success traveling through planes and are realizing that the great wheel theory may not best represent cosmology as it truly exists. They have discovered a repeatable connection to another plane where they have found a vein of incredibly rare gems that are rich in arcanic power. However, they are angering locals who plan to seek vengeance by taking what values most from the people that robbed them. They are trying to secretly sell their gems to (Needs name, gem owner) to keep prices high and not let the abundance of their resource be known
    - The plane they have reached is Arborea, specifically, Arvandor, the lowest plane in Arborea. The Mayor, being a devout follower of the Ravenqueen, has intimate knowledge of Arvandor allowing them to find a highway. The section of Arvandor they have found is inhabited largely by cyclops and giants.
    - They have figured out how to create a tear in the astral plane similar to a gate spell through scientific means
- Cultists of the Raven Queen
    - Mayor Blackburne being a shadar-kai leader of this cult, wants to find a way to free his lover in a quarantined pocket of undead nearby. Her lover, being a servant of the raven queen, was in battle to destroy the undead that inhabited the area. He believes she is still alive and in danger. Unbeknownst to him, she is petrified and being used as bait by a Nagpa in wait, determined to eradicate any followers of the Ravenqueen.
    - T
- Van Green Family (Suspicious of Mayor Blackburne - wants to smear him)
    - this is where we can use Mayor Blackburne's sudden appearance and claim to fame against him
- (Needs Name) and his gang
    - Owner of a prestigious gem shop, additionally owns a metal working plant in the poorer parts of the city, runs a ring of robbers/pillagers/slavery, to keep his material costs high, despite the regularity of the metals he uses.
    - They want to tighten their grip on resource supply and smear the reputation of other precious metal and gem workers.
        - Idea for situation, college kid wants to buy an engagement ring but its outrageously expensive
- Silas and the gang
    - Think something is funny going on with the astral nexus. Former colleagues haven't been seen in months, they want to the bottom of it.


# Next Steps
- For the Gazzeteer (sp) we need disctricts with basic descriptions.
    - would be nice to add a note about the basic history of the district, along with what populations live there.
- itemizing a couple of landmarks
- itemizing a couple services
- itemize some locations with basic descriptions/characters within each district
- come up with an adventure site for each faction??

## History Note
- Undead and other evil remnants weren't behind the screen with the divine quarantine was issued. This creates certain dangers and superstitions.

- for luke's character pockets of undead are quarantined and house Blackburne's woman is a part of a group of drow being harvested by vampyres. His master is locked behind the divine quarantine that is a city state ruled by vampyres. The vampyres rule a slum of drow people kept alive for their blood.

- we will `need churches` dedicated to whatever god put the undead behind the quarantine as gratitude.. however some people may have a 'what have they done for me lately type attitude'

- It seems that the *Great Wheel Cosmology* theory has some flaws. The boys at the astral nexus laboratory have come up with a more accurate mathematical model that can greater predict the relationships between the planes
