# The World

A group of incredible minds, though not gifted in the arcane, were able to discover natural phenomenon that created magical effects. More pointedly, they discovered naturally occurring particles that weave the planes together. In (insert school name here), some researchers in a lab were able to create a rift to the astral plane. They demonstrated their findings publicly and all were amazed. Investors have poured their resources into their new technology because they claimed their solution doesn't rely on expensive components like their magical counterpart.

As the research grew legs, we began to understand that there was much more to the material plane. They created pressurized vehicles that could send passengers through the astral plane and discovered many other worlds. However, some of these worlds weaved planes differently than we on our original sector of the material plane. The result is incredible metals/ores/gems etc. with all sorts of properties being formed. 

These metals could possess the source of great power, or yeild unimaginable wealth to the right buyer.

# Encounter Ideas

1. spacecraft swallowed by a large space kraken and the players have to find their way out
1. Time tombs. Players can place or displace someone from power 20 years from now. No consequences are apparent in the present, but cataclysm consequences appear in the future. Players can be visited by time tomb visions and be given secrets of the present depending on if they helped one faction or the other (or greatly deceived).
1. undying peoples that are regenerated (like from hyperion) that follow a cult like symbol of a villain disguised in a bright light. If indoctrinated, are cursed

# Villian

- An event has happened, supposedly set in motion by this character or alternatively, this character is taking advantage of circumstance caused by this event.
- This character should be motivated by power or security (claimed to be the only long term sustainable motivations)
- This character can have a secondary motive like revenge or something
- Outline their specific fears so that these can be used to establish her motivations. Ie, the villain could be working with a dragon because she fears she will be assassinated.

# Map

- lay out basic map using a tool
- identify a few towns, cities, and adventure sites.
- adventure sites can be fleshed out later, but cities and towns should know what each area is known for (commodity/trade/research etc.) and what unusual customs that place has. For example, at midday everyone stops and prays to the sun god or something to that effect.
- for adventure sites, do something similiar. Provide it's description as it exists today, and what the original intention of the area is. For example, some ruins could be "you see orcs resting under a crumbled archway" but it was originally a bathing pool used by druids or something, idk.

# McGuffins (plot 'artefacts')

- These are 'artefacts' or materials that the villain (or side villains) may be seeking
- Define some basic properties of these materials
- place them in particular locations

# Web of Plot hooks

- For each location, think of two reasons this location is tied to another location. This allows players to go to any area and be in the right spot, so to speak

# Campaign Start

- Where? Identify second favorite spot on the map, and put players 'near' it.
- The antagonists central plot needs to be foreshadowed in the first session. This foreshadowing doesn't have to have anything to do with the first session's quest (and in fact, it is better if it doesn't)
