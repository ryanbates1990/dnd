### The engineering error

### The Lumber Company


- The lumber union members led by Rodney Muske request aid in a mutinous plan to overthrow kenny loggins to provide more saftey to the union
- He informs the players that he overheard Kenny Loggins talking about secret plans and a map in his office located in the Lumber Warehouse
- Rodney Tells them the he thinks Kenny is testing his inventions in an undisclosed location and getting biased safety approvals

- He asks that whatever testing is being done there, to mess it up undetected so that no one gets hurt again

### The Warehouse

- is guarded by 3 guards
- has a random employee getting something out of his locker

### The Office

- schematics with all sorts of invention ideas, some look really terrible, some have big x's accrossed it. Some look rather dumb but have big check marks on them.
- A chalk board
- A calendar with something scheduled this evening that just says "bunker, 11pm, meet Ridley, Top Down"
- A drawer full of interesting minerals
- A letter from 'Peabody's mining company' that just says, "Thank you Mr. Loggins but we are formally denying your request. We may be able to compromise and we would like to continue to do business together however we find your ask overly ambitious. We will send a letter with terms we think are more reasoble. Keep an eye out on the post. Signed, Peabody's Mining Co."
- A map drawn of intermediate skill that has the location of the Bunker on it.

### The Jungle

- Players find a felled portion of the tree felled but with 2 people dangling from the tops of another tree, each glowing from mushroom torches. One body has been mangled and eaten. the other belongs to someone who is being eaten alive by a large spider. Kenny Loggins is seen running from the scene.
- A Phase Spider and a Giant Spider appear
- It is possible during the encounter with the spider that someone steps on a patch of mushroom spores. If they do they must make wisdom save to prevent being charmed by the mushrooms.
- After the spider is defeated, the players, upon proper investigation, notice that the spiders feet are all coated with a ton of the sirenic mushrooms but they aren't the familiar blue color, some of it looks a sickly purple and some looks a dark red.


### The Dreams

However, the last time they went in, someone got seriously hurt and the school athorities have placed serious precautions on enterring the jungle. Just too much Red Tape and beaurocracy making it near impossible. They've made rules about visibility conditions and plant density. They want the party to meet them at the jungles edge unseen at night. 

### The Red Amunita Mushrooms
