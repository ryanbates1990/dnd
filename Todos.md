- Make actual hard rules on what the mycelium network can do.
- Jungle rewards for high perception rolls
- Line in the jungle where things start to.... die
- Some relevant information that was in June's notes
- Make a place of worship in the town (maybe some sort of druidic grotto). Cool idea is if an animal hanging out there turns into a human in the front of their eyes
- Make stats for Priscilla
- Introduce Janick

- When they travel into the jungle the next time, they need to find something interesting.


- lood for beating the sirenic demon idea: bag of beans. Also maybe an amulet of plane shifting somewhere

Todo for today:
- Come up with lines for the "mushrooms"
- Have an encounter on deck, either for the river or for in the jungle.
- Have the entrance to the dungeon and maybe a first couple rooms on deck
