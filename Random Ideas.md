- Ruins in a large cave with giant scale everything, come to a smooth round plateau with a large pentagram-e type ritual thing. Have players do a puzzle to get the runes to show up and enter a portal into another dimension. Old book with notes that provides hint to the players.

- Network of Myceleum is communicating and constantly knows the whereabouts of the players. The fungus aims to lure the players into a deadly trap where they will meet a deadly foe.

- Running into a group of pissed off dwarves that normally live in the volcano trying to sneak there way into an elven city


- Owner of the Poison Well bar has a husband that has gone missing. Truth is, they've heard so many rumors of what is happening in the jungle, they caught wind of a dungeon with great treasures and they're trying to retrieve it. In actuality there is some teleportation/ritual temple that leads to another plane where there are riches but lots of fiends and devils trying to enslave the creatures. If any are killed they seek revenge and want to come back to the material plane for vengeance.


# IDEA FOR BBEG
- runs a fight ring in the underbelly of cloudspire, wants to harness beasts from the Jungle to fight people in his arena


# Dungeon idea
- Natural tunnel created by a large wyrm like being.. who's remains are findable. Traversing the tunnels turns into evidence of manmade interference.
