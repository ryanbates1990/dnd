# Prifdinnas

Founded by an elvish clan who deeply valued isolation and privacy. They wanted to be left alone. I don't know why they chose the jungle given it's extreme climate, but Ehrendil was of the original settlers. 

**Location:**  Deep in the Lukagayo Jungle. Presumably underneath the worldtree.
**Notable Entrances:**  Unknown. The River that runs through the Lukagayo Jungle forks into 9 separate streams through a series of caves. Unknown how this delta formed. Within this series of caves lies a labrynth made by the elves. The elves know the secret to enterring Prifdinnas.  
**Appearance:**  Lit by a combination of arcane lamps and bioluminescent plantlife underneath the worldtree. The River ran through the earth creating a deep underground cavern and the huge root system of the world tree creates large wooden columns. The river, though small, still runs through the cavern. Akin to a small canyon underground. The elves carved homes and structures both out of the wooden roots (stairs, sculptures, housing) and the wooden sides of the canyon. Both expertly done, ordaned with many jewels and silver metals.  
**Rulers:**  Ehrendil and a group of advisors (those who left the feywild with him)  
**Culture:**  Expert in the arcane, survival, and masonry. They are more proud, lack hospitality.  
**Notable Sites:**  Wooden columns and spiral staircases made from the tree's root system. Carved residential areas made from stone. The bathhouse along the river, Garden of divinity.
