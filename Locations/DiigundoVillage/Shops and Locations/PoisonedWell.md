`Description`: 
- `Outdoors`: Kind of looks like a western bar. Big Patio, swinging doors, big overhanging roof to protect from the weather.
- `Indoors`: The Bar is against the left wall and attached is a door to an office as well as a small walk-in kitchen type area and closet. The place is surprisingly opulent with a large, red and black rug with gold trimming taking up most of the parlour. The place is decorated with Large bird skeletons and paintings of exotic, colourful plants. Soft piano music plays in the background. It is a well lit bar with plenty of windows and torchlight.
