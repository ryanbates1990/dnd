## Pestle & Mortar (Apothecary)

`Occupants`:
1. Herb (Owner)
1. Jenny (Gnomish Intern)

`Description`: 
- `Outdoors`: Small to Medium Cabin with an A-Frame roof extending far away from the frame of the house. Half of the roof is glass and has a retractable tarp on top. The outdoors is rather overgrown and wild in nature with vines and shrubbery but some of the wild is pretty with blossoming flowers. If at night, some of the foliage emits a light blue bioluminescence.
- `Indoors`: Plants everywhere and all sorts of glassware. Hanging fungi and chile's being dried in the sun from the glass rooftop. Potions in the back are in a glass case that are lit by small torches of bioluminescent material, some sort of fungus.
