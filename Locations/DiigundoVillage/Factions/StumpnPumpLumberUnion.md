## Stump 'n Pump Lumber Yard Union
- The Stump 'n Pump Lumber Company was founded much farther north and boomed off the felling of coastal palm trees and more inwardly, pine. As the company decimated all in it's path it did realize the error of it's ways and now reaps much of it's success by farming pine and palms, though the farming cycle is quite long and is not quite successful. Investors have made their claim and kept the business afloat.
- The Company found new life with the discovery of the Feverwood Trees however they have difficult managing the Gympie Plants and other unpleasant things from within the jungle. A single Feverwood tree is monetarily worth that of 40 pines but is much more tedious to extract and cannot be done so efficiently and requires special teams and equipment.
- The Union is often disgruntled by lack of pay and safety precautions. Employees are often used as guinea pigs to test new equipment and methods of extraction against the difficulties provided by the jungle.
