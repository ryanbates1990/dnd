# Diigundo Village

A recently developed village (As far as northerners goes, no one knows what happened to the original Diigundan village. Rumour is they were executed to eliminate competition) that is booming quickly yet is a bit of an oasis as far as commercial development goes. Logging is the primary reason to come here as it resides on the edge of the Lugakayo Jungle. The forest provides a valuable lumber that is particularly hard and sturdy and is high demand from the northern kingdoms. Locals have also developed a drug problem from hallucinogens found in the jungle.

Not much is known of the Lugakayo Jungle and is often linked to superstition and disease. Because of this, the logging done in the area is highly lucrative and a highly dangerous job. Recent excursions from both Universities and Government Researches are sent in the form of botanists and bodyguards to learn from the jungle to try and uncover what is so dangerous (or, to reveal that there is no actual danger). Botanists typically want to learn from the jungle (medicinal purposes, research the animals and see there positive impact on the volatile ecosystem) and the bodyguards that typically accompany want to thwart their efforts in attempt to prove the area non-threatening and it all a hoax. This creates a tension among the populus
