# Notable Plants 

## The Feverwood Trees

Lugakayo is known for its recent economization of highly durable an sought after wood coming from the `Feverwood Tree`. The wood is primarily used for furniture as cheaper wood can be used for structural purposes. It is dark in colour but very hard and takes a skilled woodworker to make use of. The Feverwood trees are tall and girthy who's branches grow parallel to the ground in fractal pinwheels to allow sunlight to get to the lower branches, but the taller they are, the weaker the lower branches become. The leaves are a bright, green and are very large, like elephant ears. 

The tree was given the name given that the large leaves often block the sunlight to base of the earth, creating a darker, danker area prime for poisonous undergrowth (most notorious is the `Gympie Plant`), and most notably, the `Sirenic Myceleum`. 

## The Sirenic Myceleum

Recognized most easily as budding long, skinny toadstools that emit a blue bioluminescent glow. Grows most easily in darker, danker areas but if transported is quite durable for a mushroom and can be used as a soft light source. The mushrooms are quite beautiful and the spores, if breathed in heavily, have an effect akin to charm person, leaving a fond impression. The effect typically leaves the person feeling fondly and wanting to protect the mushrooms. This acts as a defense mechanism for the mushroom, it gains companionship. 

A skilled alchemist/herbalist would find that when used in potions, the sirenic mushroom is a prime ingredient in a potion that allows you to see in darkness (albeit poorly).

`Plot point, unbeknownst to players`: Though these mushrooms aren't widely consumed (by humans and animals alike), they provide value to the ecosystem by feeding off the sickness of other plants. They live off the bacteria that keeps other plants healthy. In addition, they can help the roots of plants reach water further down into the soil. The Sirenic mushroom is actually core to the jungle's wild success, and allowing the jungle to reach the scale that it has. In fact, feverwood trees are so dependent on the mushroom to protect from disease, that the feverwood trees would not survive without it. Similarly, the Sirenic mushroom depends on the health of the feverwood trees for cloudcover. 

The Sirenic Mushroom is part of a mycelium network. It has memories and can tranport nutrients from some one plant to another if it has need. The network `has been corrupted` and is being controlled by shamanistic-cultists to use the charming effects of the mycelium to lure beings into a trap to feed a demonic monster. Their feedings are sacrificial and please a dark God.. `Come up with a name for the God and what happens if the cultists are successful`

## The Gympie Plant

Inspired by the real, Gympie Gympie aka the suicid plant. when rubbed against results in excruciating pain that can last for hours or days at a time. Results only in a minor rash and no actual lasting damage.. but consequences are dire. The plant is known for it's "furry leaves" which gain the appearance from small hairs and is a light, seafoam green colour and grows in vine like fashion either across the floor of the jungle or on other plants. The hairs are what injects the toxin. When the plant is heavily disrupted, the hairs flake off and effect anyone in a 5 foot radius (this is to prevent players from abusing the plant for its effect, though it is possible I suppose)

When exposed, players (or NPC's) must make a DC constitution save of 13. On a failed save, the player is in excruciating pain and has disadvantages on all skill checks for 20 minutes.

### Ideas: 
Incan style pyramids and dungeons

Pocket villages of humans that chose to reside in the jungle or were bullied into it by northern kingdoms with primitive tech
Shamans (Many are evil specializing in mind control and possession)

Dinosaurs (living and necrotic)
Bioluminescent plants
Giant bugs
A Volcano

Labrynth of Rivers (that when properly navigated leads to a city of elves)
Tree Villages of Elves
Diamond Veins
